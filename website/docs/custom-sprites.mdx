## Adding sprites as resources {#sprites-as-resources}

First of all, get your sprites and convert them to PNG or JPEG, if they're not already PNG- or JPEG-encoded.

Then, change the files' extensions to `.bin`. This way Visual Studio will recognize the files as binary data instead of bitmaps.

:::note
Unfortunately, we can't import images from bitmaps, because Unity's System.Drawing.dll is just filled with stubs. So, we'll have to import images as binary data, until someone finds a better solution.

Right-click on your project, go a-a-all the way down and click **Properties**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/project-properties.png')} width='300'/>

Go to **Resources** tab and click on *that* button to create a resources file:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/create-resources.png')} width='800'/>

Select **Add resource** at the top of the menu and click **Add existing file...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/add-resource.png')} width='600'/>

Now just find your images (with `.bin` extension) and add them as resources:

Now you should be able to reference your sprites' data from the code like this: `Properties.Resources.<ResourceName>`.

If you get an error, then make sure that the default namespace, that is specified in project's properties in **Application** tab, is the same as the one you're using.

## `RogueSprite` {#roguesprite}

:::note
If you're wondering, why it's called `RogueSprite` and not `CustomSprite`, like most of the things in RogueLibs (`CustomItem`, `CustomTrait`, `CustomEffect`), well, that's because it behaves slightly differently from others. `CustomItem`, `CustomTrait` and etc. are hooks, while `RogueSprite`, technically, is a collection of hooks. Also, it took an incredible amount of time and work to figure out that TK2D stuff and I just wanted to distinguish it from other classes.
:::

Normally, new instances of `RogueSprite` are created like this:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<MyCustomItem>()
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomItem);
```

But you can create them directly too, although you'll have to specify a name and a scope. Scope of the sprite determines what areas of the game the sprite will be available in. `SpriteScope.Items` will work only on items, `SpriteScope.Objects` - only on objects, and etc. You can specify multiple scopes too by combining them with `|` operator.

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName);
```

By default, RogueLibs uses the entire file as a texture. You can specify the region of the texture used with a `Rect` parameter:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(32f, 32f, 64f, 64f));
```

If you're going to use non-64x64 textures, then you need to specify the PPU (pixels-per-unit) parameter too:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(64f, 64f, 128f, 128f), 128f);
```

## Sprite variations {#sprite-variations}

If you have more than 1 sprite for your item, use `InvItem.LoadItemSprite` in your item's `SetupDetails`:

```csharp
public class Present : CustomItem, IItemUsable
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<Present>()
            /* ... */
            .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.Present);

        RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("Present2", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.Present2);
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("Present3", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.Present3);
    }

    public override void SetupDetails()
	{
        /* ... */
		int rnd = new Random().Next(3) + 1;
        // random integer x, such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 3

        if (rnd != 1) // load a different sprite if it's 2 or 3
		    Item.LoadItemSprite($"Present{rnd}");

        // if it's 1, then the default "Present" will be used
	}
}
```

This example works only if an item actually exists. In the Loadout and Rewards menus it will always have the `Present` sprite. If you want the sprite in the menus to be randomly selected too, you'll have to [override the `DisplayedUnlock.GetImage` method](./unlocks/overriding-behavior#examples).
