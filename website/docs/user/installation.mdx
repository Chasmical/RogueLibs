# Installation

To start using mods, first you need to install BepInEx, the modding framework that we're using to mod Streets of Rogue. Then, install RogueLibs (both plugin and patcher - two different important files) and then any mods that you want to play with. You can find a lot of mods on [SoR ModHub](https://sugarbarrel.github.io/SoRModHub) or [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/8455).

## Installing BepInEx {#bepinex}

**If you already have BepInEx installed, [skip this step](#roguelibs).**

### Downloading BepInEx {#bepinex-downloading}

**[Go here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) and download the version for your OS:**

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Download the version of BepInEx for your game's executable's type:

- **`BepInEx_x64_5.x.y.z.zip`** is for **64-bit** executables.
- **`BepInEx_x86_5.x.y.z.zip`** is for **32-bit** executables.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/downloading-windows.png')}/>

Here's a few pointers:

- You might notice some files in the game's root directory: **`Galaxy64.dll`**, **`UnityCrashHandler64.exe`**. If you have these, then I'm pretty sure it means that the game's executable is also **64-bit**.
- Launch the game and open the Task Manager. If you see "(32 bit)" in the name of the game's process, then it's **32-bit**; otherwise, it's **64-bit**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem values={["linux", "macos"]}>

- Simply download **`BepInEx_unix_5.x.y.z.zip`.**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/downloading-unix.png')}/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution BepInEx v6
BepInEx v6 pre-release recently came out. Don't use it yet. All of the mods at the moment still use BepInEx v5.4.x, and if you install v6, the mods probably won't work. BepInEx developers plan on supporting older v5 plugins in the future, so once a stable v6 version comes out, you should be able to use it.

### Extracting files {#bepinex-extract}

<Tabs
    groupId="vendor"
    defaultValue="steam"
    values={[
        {label: 'I know where my game is installed!', value: 'none'},
        {label: 'Steam', value: 'steam'},
        {label: 'GOG', value: 'gog'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="steam">

Open Steam's game library, right-click on the game and click **Properties...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/finding-the-game-1.png')} width='300'/>

Go to **Local files** and click **Browse...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/finding-the-game-2.png')} width='600'/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gog">

Try looking at these paths:

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

- `C:\GOG Games`;
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG.com`;
- `C:\Program Files\GOGcom`; <!-- yep, without the dot -->

</TabItem>
<TabItem values={["linux", "macos"]}>

- `$HOME/GOG Games`;

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Extract the contents of the .zip file into the game's root directory.**

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Make sure you extract it the right way. There's a lot of wrong ways, apparently.

- Make sure that `BepInEx` folder is in the same directory as your game's executable (`StreetsOfRogue.exe`);
- Make sure that you extract the `doorstop_config.ini` and `winhttp.dll` files too;

- Make sure that `BepInEx` and `doorstop_libs` folders are in the same directory as your game's executable (`StreetsOfRogue.x86` or `StreetsOfRogue.x86_64`);
- Make sure that you extract the `run_bepinex.sh` file too;

### Running the game {#bepinex-first-run}

:::note
You need to run the game at least once, so that BepInEx can generate config files and directories!
:::

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Just run the game. Either through an executable, or any game launcher.

You can close the game once you see a logo or a loading screen.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

Open the included `run_bepinex.sh` script and edit the highlighted line to be the name of the executable:

```bash title="run_bepinex.sh"
#!/bin/sh
# BepInEx running script
#
# This script is used to run a Unity game with BepInEx enabled.
#
# Usage: Configure the script below and simply run this script when you want to run your game modded.

# -------- SETTINGS --------
# ---- EDIT AS NEEDED ------

# EDIT THIS: The name of the executable to run
# LINUX: This is the name of the Unity game executable 
# MACOS: This is the name of the game app folder, including the .app suffix
# highlight-next-line
executable_name="StreetsOfRogue"

# The rest is automatically handled by BepInEx
# ...
```

Open the terminal in the game's root directory and add execution permission to the script:

<BrowserWindow>

```bash
chmod u+x run_bepinex.sh
```

</BrowserWindow>

Now you can run BepInEx by executing the script:

<BrowserWindow>

```bash
./run_bepinex.sh
```

</BrowserWindow>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

## Installing RogueLibs {#roguelibs}

<Tabs
    defaultValue="v3"
    values={[
        {label:'RogueLibs v3.x.x', value:'v3'},
        {label:'RogueLibs v2.x.x', value:'v2'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="v3">

**[Download the latest RogueLibs version](https://github.com/SugarBarrel/RogueLibs/releases/latest)**

You need to download only two files: `RogueLibsCore.dll` and `RogueLibsPatcher.dll`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/download-roguelibs.png')}/>

Go to the BepInEx's directory and put `RogueLibsCore.dll` file into `plugins` directory:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/i18n/ru/installation/drag-plugins.gif')} width="600"/>

Put `RogueLibsPatcher.dll` file into `patchers` directory:

:::caution
The directory is called **`patchers`**, it's different from **`plugins`**.
:::

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/i18n/ru/installation/drag-patchers.gif')} width="600"/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="v2">

:::caution
RogueLibs v2.x.x is outdated and is not compatible with new mods!
:::

**[Download the latest RogueLibs version](https://github.com/SugarBarrel/RogueLibs/releases/tag/v2.2-pre.2)**

You need to download only one file - `RogueLibs.dll`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/download-roguelibs-v2.png')}/>

Go to the BepInEx's directory and put `RogueLibs.dll` file into `plugins` directory:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/i18n/ru/installation/drag-plugins.gif')} width="600"/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing plugins (mods) {#plugins}

Download the mods that you want to install (`.dll` files).

And put these `.dll` files in the `BepInEx/plugins` directory.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/i18n/ru/installation/drag-mods.gif')} width="600"/>

## Where can I get mods? {#mod-sources}

**[SoR ModHub](https://sugarbarrel.github.io/SoRModHub)** is a collection of mods that use the latest RogueLibs v3 that I know about. Includes links to other mod sources as well, and is updated pretty regularly.

**[GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/8455)** - Streets of Rogue's official mod-sharing place. Some mods don't get released or updated there, since the process of setting up or updating a page is way too long and overly complicated.

The **[#👍|modding-gallery🔧](https://discord.gg/m3zuHSwQw2)** channel in the official SoR's Discord. You'll find all of the latest info, updates and bugfixes there. It's kind of hard to search for specific mods though.

ModDB and NexusMods are barely used at all.
