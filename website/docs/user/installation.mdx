## Installing BepInEx {#bepinex}

**If you already have BepInEx installed, [skip this step](#roguelibs).**

### Downloading BepInEx {#bepinex-downloading}

**[Go here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) and download the version for your OS:**

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Download the version of BepInEx for your game's executable's type:

- **`BepInEx_x64_5.x.y.z.zip`** is for **64-bit** executables.
- **`BepInEx_x86_5.x.y.z.zip`** is for **32-bit** executables.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/downloading-windows.png')}/>

Here's a few pointers:

- You might notice some files in the game's root directory: **`Galaxy64.dll`**, **`UnityCrashHandler64.exe`**. If you have these, then I'm pretty sure it means that the game's executable is also **64-bit**.
- Launch the game and open the Task Manager. If you see "(32 bit)" in the name of the game's process, then it's **32-bit**; otherwise, it's **64-bit**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem values={["linux", "macos"]}>

- Simply download **`BepInEx_unix_5.x.y.z.zip`.**

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Extracting files {#bepinex-extract}

<Tabs
    groupId="vendor"
    defaultValue="steam"
    values={[
        {label: 'I know where my game is installed!', value: 'none'},
        {label: 'Steam', value: 'steam'},
        {label: 'GOG', value: 'gog'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="steam">

Open Steam's game library, right-click on the game and click **Properties...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/finding-the-game-1.png')} width='300'/>

Go to **Local files** and click **Browse...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/installation/finding-the-game-2.png')} width='600'/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gog">

Try looking at these paths:

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

- `C:\GOG Games`;
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG.com`;
- `C:\Program Files\GOGcom`; <!-- yep, without the dot -->

</TabItem>
<TabItem values={["linux", "macos"]}>

- `$HOME/GOG Games`;

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Extract the contents of the .zip file into the game's root directory.**

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Make sure you extract it the right way. There's a lot of wrong ways, apparently.

- Make sure that `BepInEx` folder is in the same directory as your game's executable (`StreetsOfRogue.exe`);
- Make sure that you extract the `doorstop_config.ini` and `winhttp.dll` files too;

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

Make sure you extract it the right way. There's a lot of wrong ways, apparently.

- Make sure that `BepInEx` and `doorstop_libs` folders are in the same directory as your game's executable (`StreetsOfRogue.x86` or `StreetsOfRogue.x86_64`);
- Make sure that you extract the `run_bepinex.sh` file too;

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

### Running the game {#bepinex-first-run}

:::note
You need to run the game at least once, so that BepInEx can generate config files and directories!
:::

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

<Tabs
    groupId="os"
    defaultValue="win"
    values={[
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
        {label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="win">

Just run the game. Either through an executable, or any game launcher.

You can close the game once you see a logo or a loading screen.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

Open the included `run_bepinex.sh` script and edit the highlighted line to be the name of the executable:

```bash title="run_bepinex.sh"
#!/bin/sh
# BepInEx running script
#
# This script is used to run a Unity game with BepInEx enabled.
#
# Usage: Configure the script below and simply run this script when you want to run your game modded.

# -------- SETTINGS --------
# ---- EDIT AS NEEDED ------

# EDIT THIS: The name of the executable to run
# LINUX: This is the name of the Unity game executable 
# MACOS: This is the name of the game app folder, including the .app suffix
# highlight-next-line
executable_name="StreetsOfRogue"

# The rest is automatically handled by BepInEx
# ...
```

Open the terminal in the game's root directory and add execution permission to the script:

<BrowserWindow>

```bash
chmod u+x run_bepinex.sh
```

</BrowserWindow>

Now you can run BepInEx by executing the script:

<BrowserWindow>

```bash
./run_bepinex.sh
```

</BrowserWindow>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

Open the included `run_bepinex.sh` script and edit the highlighted line to be the name of the executable **(including the `.app` extension)**:
