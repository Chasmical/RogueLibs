# Introduction

RogueLibs is a library for modding Streets of Rogue.

The game's code is pretty bad, so if you try to mod the game yourself, you'll end up with way too many patches! Let RogueLibs handle all of the patching, and **you just focus on the content!**

Check out the [installation guide](user/installation)!

There's also a [Getting Started](getting-started) guide for plugin developers!

:::note Work-In-Progress

The guide is still being worked on!
