# Custom Languages*

You can add your custom languages to the game using the `LanguageService.RegisterLanguageCode` method.

import Tabs from '@site/src/components/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@site/src/components/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

```csharp
LanguageService.RegisterLanguageCode("japanese", (LanguageCode)123);
```

:::info Work-In-Progress
There hasn't been much progress on actually implementing custom languages. No one has ever translated the entire game to a different language, not yet included with SoR. When that time comes, feel free to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/issues/new/choose).

`LanguageService` is a static class, that contains all of the things related to localization.

## Adding localizations for mods {#localizations}

:::info Work-In-Progress
Eh. Just ask the creator(s) of the mod, that you want to translate, to include your localization.
