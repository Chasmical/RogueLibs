## `UnlockWrapper` class {#unlockwrapper}

All of the unlocks in the game are wrapped in a more flexible class - `UnlockWrapper`.

`UnlockWrapper` provides methods to get the unlock's name, description, image and other stuff.

:::caution
You probably shouldn't implement `UnlockWrapper` directly. Use the classes described later on the page.
:::

## `DisplayedUnlock` class {#displayedunlock}

`DisplayedUnlock` derives from the `UnlockWrapper` class. It provides methods to display the unlock in the in-game menus.

:::caution
You shouldn't implement `DisplayedUnlock` directly either. Use the classes described later on the page.

## Unlock classes {#unlock-classes}

RogueLibs provides the following classes that you can derive from:

- `ItemUnlock` - for items;
- `AbilityUnlock` - for abilities;
- `TraitUnlock` - for traits;
- `MutatorUnlock` - for mutators;
- `AgentUnlock` - for agents;
- `BigQuestUnlock` - for agent Big Quests;
- `ExtraUnlock` - for achievements and other stuff;
- `FloorUnlock` - for floor unlocks;

:::note
There's also a couple of classes that are in RogueLibs only for compatibility reasons.

## Initialization {#initialization}

You can initialize your unlocks like this:

```csharp title="MyCustomItem.cs"
public class MyCustomItem : CustomItem
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<MyCustomItem>();
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Item"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Item is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"));
            .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomItem)
            // highlight-next-line
            .WithUnlock(new ItemUnlock
            {
                UnlockCost = 10,
                CharacterCreationCost = 5,
                LoadoutCost = 4,
            });
    }
}
```

Or you can just initialize them directly (like in case of mutators):

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomUnlock(new MutatorUnlock("MyMutator"))
    .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("Mutator Name"))
    .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("Mutator Description"));
```
