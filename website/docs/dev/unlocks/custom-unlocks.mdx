# Custom Unlocks

Custom unlocks allow your custom content to be accessed through vanilla menus. Unlike other hooks, unlocks persist throughout the game, and get destroyed and created only when initially loading the game or changing save slots. RogueLibs also creates wrappers around vanilla unlocks, to ensure the compatibility of your unlocks with the vanilla ones.

import Tabs from '@site/src/components/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@site/src/components/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

`UnlockWrapper` is a flexible wrapper around a `Unlock` class, and provides methods to get the unlock's name, description, image and other stuff. It is the base class for any and all custom or vanilla unlocks.

`DisplayedUnlock` derives from the `UnlockWrapper` class. It provides methods to display the unlock in the in-game menus. You can alter or augment your unlock's name and description, and even use [Unity's rich text formatting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/StyledText.html). Note, that all rich text formatting tags have to be closed (this was introduced in one of the Unity versions).

:::caution
You probably shouldn't implement `UnlockWrapper` or `DisplayedUnlock` directly. Use the classes described below.

## Unlock classes {#unlock-classes}

RogueLibs provides the following classes that you can derive from:

- `ItemUnlock` - for items;
- `AbilityUnlock` - for abilities;
- `TraitUnlock` - for traits;
- `MutatorUnlock` - for mutators;
- `AgentUnlock` - for agents;
- `BigQuestUnlock` - for agent Big Quests;
- `ExtraUnlock` - for achievements and other stuff;
- `FloorUnlock` - for floor unlocks;

:::note
There's also a couple of classes that are in RogueLibs only for compatibility reasons.

## Initialization {#initialization}

You can initialize your unlocks like this:

```csharp title="MyCustomItem.cs"
public class MyCustomItem : CustomItem
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<MyCustomItem>()
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Item"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Item is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"))
            .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomItem)
            // highlight-next-line
            .WithUnlock(new ItemUnlock
            {
                UnlockCost = 10,
                CharacterCreationCost = 5,
                LoadoutCost = 4,
            });
    }
}
```

Or you can just initialize them directly (like in case of mutators):

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomUnlock(new MutatorUnlock("MyMutator"))
    .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("Mutator Name"))
    .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("Mutator Description"));
```
