## Adding binary resources {#binary-resources}

First of all, encode your images in PNG or JPG format, and audioclips in MP3, OGG or WAV.

Then go to your project's Properties and create a resource file, if it doesn't exist already.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/setup/resources.png')} width='600'/>

Open your project's `Resources.resx` in an **external** editor and add the following element to the end:

```xml
  <!-- ... -->
// highlight-start
  <data name="MyAwesomeSprite" type="System.Resources.ResXFileRef, System.Windows.Forms">
    <value>..\Resources\MyAwesomeSprite.png;System.Byte[], mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
  </data>
// highlight-end
</root>
```

You only need to change the `name` attribute and the first part of the `value` element for your resources. Then you should be able to reference them like this: `Properties.Resources.MyAwesomeSprite`. You can do the same thing with other types of files as well, like audioclips, fonts and models.

After changing the `.resx` file, go to your solution and rebuild the resources code by right-clicking on Resources.resx and selecting "Run Custom Tool".

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/custom-sprites/run-custom-tool.png')} width='400'/>

## `RogueSprite` {#roguesprite}

:::note
If you're wondering, why it's called `RogueSprite` and not `CustomSprite`, like most of the things in RogueLibs (`CustomItem`, `CustomTrait`, `CustomEffect`), well, that's because it behaves slightly differently from others. `CustomItem`, `CustomTrait` and etc. are hooks, while `RogueSprite`, technically, is a collection of hooks. Also, it took an incredible amount of time and work to figure out that TK2D stuff and I just wanted to distinguish it from other classes.
:::

Normally, new instances of `RogueSprite` are created like this:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<MyCustomItem>()
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomItem);
```

But you can create them directly too, although you'll have to specify a name and a scope. Scope of the sprite determines what areas of the game the sprite will be available in. `SpriteScope.Items` will work only on items, `SpriteScope.Objects` - only on objects, and etc. You can specify multiple scopes too by combining them with `|` operator.

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName);
```

By default, RogueLibs uses the entire file as a texture. You can specify the region of the texture to use with a `Rect` parameter (for example, if you included a color palette used in the image by its side and don't want to include it):

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(0f, 0f, 64f, 64f));
```

If you're going to use non-64x64 textures, then you need to specify the PPU (pixels-per-unit) parameter too:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(64f, 64f, 128f, 128f), 128f);
```

## Sprite variations {#sprite-variations}

If you have more than 1 sprite for your item, use `InvItem.LoadItemSprite` in your item's `SetupDetails`:

```csharp
public class Present : CustomItem, IItemUsable
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<Present>()
            /* ... */
            .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.Present);

        RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("Present2", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.Present2);
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("Present3", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.Present3);
    }

    public override void SetupDetails()
    {
        /* ... */
    int rnd = new Random().Next(3) + 1;
        // random integer x, such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 3

        if (rnd != 1) // load a different sprite if it's 2 or 3
        Item.LoadItemSprite($"Present{rnd}");

        // if it's 1, then the default "Present" will be used
    }
}
```

This example works only if an item actually exists. In the Loadout and Rewards menus it will always have the `Present` sprite. If you want the sprite in the menus to be randomly selected too, you'll have to [override the `DisplayedUnlock.GetImage` method](./unlocks/overriding-behavior#examples).
