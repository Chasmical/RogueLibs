So, you want to create a cool-looking website for your mod/plugin?

In this tutorial we'll be using Docusaurus, and we'll be deploying the site using GitHub Pages.

[Skip this step](#adding-components), if you already have a React website to put components into.
:::

Go to your solution's folder and execute the following command:

```bash
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init website classic --typescript
```

It will generate a website template. You can remove the `--typescript` parameter, if you want to code in pure JS.
