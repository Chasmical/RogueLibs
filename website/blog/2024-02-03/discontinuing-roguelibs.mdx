I've given it some thought, and decided to quit doing Streets of Rogue stuff.



## Why discontinue RogueLibs?

A lot of factors contributed to this decision...  
For some background, you can read the [*"My Modding Journey"* blog post](/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey).

{/* truncate */}

Here's the list, in order from most to least significant:

1. **Loss of interest, and stagnancy.** For 5 years now, I've focused all my efforts on Streets of Rogue. Almost everything I know is directly related to SoR. I need a change of pace. I want opportunities to learn other stuff, not related to SoR, as well.

2. **SoR's disgustingly awful code.** I don't see many reasons to stick around with this kind of code any longer. I am so done with it, and I believe I deserve to work on stuff with better code.

3. **I feel overqualified for this.** When I first started modding, SoR felt like a challenge. But now it's just an obstacle, stalling my growth, one that I would rather avoid instead of smashing through.

4. **Dissatisfaction with community management.** To be honest, I had expected more involvement, more teasers and such, with more effort put into it. Other than the trailers, nothing really stood out. The disproportionate amount of hype I had for the sequel led to disappointment. And to be fair, that's on me, my expectations were too high.

5. **Responsibilities and stress.** With the huge amount of issues and projects in progress, and no one else capable of handling them, it's getting rather stressful, and I really want some time for myself. And by that I don't mean just a small break, I mean finishing this chapter in my life, and moving forward. There's more to life, than just Streets of Rogue, after all.

Arguably, some of these issues can be solved, but at that point it'd be more trouble than it's worth. Perhaps, I'll just find my happiness elsewhere. It can't be hard to find a place better than this.



## So, what's gonna happen?

I'll just stop working on SoR-related projects, and I'll archive their repositories. If you want to carry on the legacy, feel free to fork the repositories and continue working on these projects.

This documentation website and all currently released files and assets will remain available. The only exception is the newer beta of the website, the one at roguelibs.com, since it incurs some maintenance costs (web server, database, CMS, CDN, domain name). I'll wipe the data there and have it shut down. The [source repository](https://github.com/Chasmical/roguelibs-web) is still available, so feel free to host one yourself.

The official Discord server can carry on without me. The Russian Discord server, though, will probably bite the dust, unless someone stands up and continues managing the Russian community.

## What will I do next?

I've been thinking a lot about more artistic and creative hobbies that I could try, such as art and writing. I&nbsp;have near-zero experience in both (I've only done simple pixel art and technical writing), but I&nbsp;guess we'll see how it works out.

As for programming, *"once a programmer, always a programmer!"* as they say.  
Need to repeat a simple mundane task on your computer thousands of times? Easy-peasy!  
Need to reliably solve some parametrized problem or build cool graphs? Yes can do!  
Something's wrong with a program? That's... investigateable and maybe fixable.  
Need a website/app/bot for a new project? Not as easy, but possible.  
An annoying ad popup on a website? *\*BOOM\** Deleted. :sunglasses:  

Since the website's repo is archived now, this blog won't be updated anymore.  
You can check on me through my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Chasmical) or my accounts on other platforms.
