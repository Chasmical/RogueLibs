I've given it some thought, and decided to quit doing Streets of Rogue stuff.



## Why discontinue RogueLibs?

A lot of factors contributed to this decision...  
For some background, you can read the [*"My Modding Journey"* blog post](/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey).

{/* truncate */}

Here's the list, in order from most to least significant:

1. **Loss of interest, and stagnancy.** For 5 years now, I've focused all my efforts on Streets of Rogue. Practically everything I know is directly related to SoR. I need a change of pace. I want opportunities to learn other stuff, not related to SoR, as well.

2. **SoR's disgustingly awful code.** I don't see many reasons to stick around with this kind of code any longer. With my self-esteem now back to normal levels, I believe I deserve to work with better code.

3. **Dissatisfaction with community management.** To be honest, I had expected more involvement, more teasers and such, with more effort put into it. Other than the trailers, nothing really stood out. The disproportionate amount of hype I had for the sequel led to disappointment. And to be fair, that's on me, my expectations were too high.

4. **Responsibilities and stress.** With the huge amount of issues and projects in progress, and no one else capable of handling them, it's getting rather stressful, and I really want some time for myself. And by that I don't mean just a small break, I mean finishing this chapter in my life, and moving forward. There's more to life, than just Streets of Rogue, after all.

5. **Stress from work.** The projects at my work are just as bad as SoR's code. This factor definitely contributed to, and accelerated my descent into madness. The work conditions are really convenient though, and it's hard to say no to money, so I don't want to quit yet.

6. **Discouragement of discussions in the community.** I saw quite a few constructive discussions on Discord get shut down for no apparent reason. I want to discuss issues and problems with the server, since, you know, discussing it is the only way to improve. But here, you'll get called petty and rude, if you point out a problem or that someone's argument doesn't make sense.

7. **Questionable approval of modding.** tinyBuild is very clear about their policy of strict adherence to all services' terms of service and agreements; and Steam's Subscriber Agreement does not allow <Abbr title="(something that gives players an unfair advantage in multiplayer)">"cheats"</Abbr> and mods. If Steam Achievement Manager (the mention of which had to be deleted) is considered a "cheat", then what about *mods* that may act as these *"cheats"*? Intent is not something that can be judged objectively, after all; and a double standard is scarier than ignorance. I don't feel as confident when making mods, knowing that it all may come crashing down the next day.

The last two are far from being the deciding factors, but they did set it all in motion.  
And arguably, some of these issues can be solved, but at that point it'd be more trouble than it's worth. Perhaps, I'll just find my happiness elsewhere. It can't be hard to find a place better than this.



## So, what's next?

I'll just stop working on SoR-related projects, and I'll archive their repositories. If you want to carry on the legacy, feel free to fork the repositories and continue working on these projects.

This documentation website and all currently released files and assets will remain available. The only exception is the newer beta of the website, the one at roguelibs.com, since it incurs some maintenance costs (web server, database, CMS, CDN, domain name). I'll wipe the data there and have it shut down. The [source repository](https://github.com/Chasmical/roguelibs-web) is still available, so feel free to host one yourself.

The official Discord server can carry on without me. The Russian Discord server, though, will probably bite the dust, unless someone stands up and continues managing the Russian community.
