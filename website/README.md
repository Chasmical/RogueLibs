# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.  
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.  
You can also run the following command to open the built server in the browser:

```console
yarn serve
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed automatically using GitHub workflows.  
Just push a commit or merge a pull request into the `main` branch.
