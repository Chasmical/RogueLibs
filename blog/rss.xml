<p>I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be modding no more. If&nbsp;you're interested in modding Streets of Rogue 2, then I suggest you read this short story, that I believe accurately represents what an experience modding this game will be...</p>

<p>At a first glance, SoR1 may appear as just the first project of an unexperienced developer. All of the mistakes Matt made were understandable, forgiveable, <em>negligible</em>. When I first started modding the game, I didn't even realize that they were bad, since I had no C# knowledge at the time. But in just a few months I learned that they <em>weren't normal</em>, they were <em>abhorrent abominations</em>, commonly brought to life by beginner developers. I had thought that it was so <em>uncannily weird</em> that Matt, a developer with many years of experience, left so many in his code. He himself had admitted that the code was bad, and said he planned to fix everything in preparation for SoR2, so I didn't think much of it. <em>Oh, how was I wrong...</em></p>
<p>No one could comprehend the entirety of SoR1's code, and very few have been able to modify just a small part of it. <em>I was one of the lucky most successful few</em>, with a library and many mods under my belt. I've seen many modders come and go, — they'd ask about getting into modding... But after directing them to dnSpy, I'd never hear from them again. SoR2 is even worse. I knew better than to expect much from Matt, but I <em>did</em> have some bare minimum expectations, — <em>I expected some improvements</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I was naive...</strong> I didn't think it could get much worse than it already was. I was not prepared for the reserve of unguessed horrors, that Matt would let loose upon the world with the demo.</p>

<p>It's straight up <strong>Cthulhuesque-adjacent</strong>. I feel like a character in one of H.P. Lovecraft's stories, that peered into the unknown too much and went insane... It damaged my sanity, and now I find myself here, rambling about the horrors I've had the unfortune to witness. But unlike true cosmic horror, I could comprehend everything I saw. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at bad code the same way again.</p>
<p>The code... It simply cannot be described — there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of principles, patterns and underlying logic. The stars were right again, and what a decades-old walk of life had failed to produce by design, a foolish inexperienced programmer had done by accident.</p>
<p>The labyrinthine execution paths twist and warp in cunning spirals that I dare not seek to interpret. The&nbsp;bizzare perversions of the familiar and the monstrous, horribly remote and distinct from programming as we know it. I <strong>never ever</strong> want to see that codebase again.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="-a-developer-with-any-degree-of-experience-3-months">... a developer with ANY degree of experience (3+ months)<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/10/15/advice-to-sor2-modders#-a-developer-with-any-degree-of-experience-3-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ... a developer with ANY degree of experience (3+ months)" title="Direct link to ... a developer with ANY degree of experience (3+ months)">​</a></h4>
<p>Give up on trying to mod SoR2. After working for so long with code of tolerable quality, you won't be able to get into modding SoR2, — its code is <em>just that horrible</em>. And by "tolerable quality" I mean the <strong>baseline lowest</strong>, the kind that money-hungry and uncaring corporations have devs work on, with no time to refactor or even fix anything. The kind of code that you hear of in anecdotes, and see in DailyWTF posts, — <strong>that</strong> is what I mean by "code of tolerable quality"! I'd much rather work on these almost mythical failures of the programming world, than attempt modding SoR2! You've got enough experience to make a decision yourself, so I'll leave the final judgement to you. Choose wisely.</p>

<p>Go ahead! Try modding it. Your sanity won't be damaged as much, as you don't yet know what good and bad code is. You may succeed at a few things, but you'll get to learn programming from the worst code in the world, so I'm unsure if you'll want to continue on this harrowing path. As you learn how to actually write code, you'll begin to understand just what kind of horrible pit you've put yourself into... Forsake the people idolizing you for your endeavors. No one will blame you for quitting.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a short cosmic horror story. A lot of people took it literally and drew conclusions out of thin air. I'm not a professional writer or anything, so it's understandable, I should have made clear that this post isn't literal. It's a mix of fiction and non-fiction. The fiction parts consisted of overexaggerated "indescribable horrors", common to the Lovecraftian horror genre. The non-fiction parts consisted of my aversion to Matt's code.</p>
<p>The first lines of the post paraphrase Lovecraft's short story "Dagon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more.</strong> Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first section ends with the paraphrasing of this part from Lovecraft's "Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species — if separate species we be — for <strong>its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The satiricity should have been extremely obvious by <em>"It's straight up <strong>Cthulhuesque-adjacent</strong>. I feel like a character in one of H.P. Lovecraft's stories"</em>. I noted the usual structure of Lovecraft's stories — written accounts of those who survived incomprehensible horrors, and even paraphrased one of the most famous quotes from "The Call of Cthulhu".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Thing can not be described—there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.</strong> A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. <strong>The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.</strong> After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last paragraph of the second section was pretty standard for cosmic horror - a mess of contradicting pretentious words and descriptors, with a bit of paraphrasing of Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The characters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world’s expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something <strong>horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it</strong>; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third section couldn't have much quotes and paraphrasing, as it needed a lot of non-fiction to tie it all together, so I just put it together myself. And then the story ends with a slightly ominous warning.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="on-a-serious-note">On a serious note,<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/10/15/advice-to-sor2-modders#on-a-serious-note" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On a serious note," title="Direct link to On a serious note,">​</a></h4>
<p>I really did want to mod SoR2, but the current state of the code doesn't allow it. The excuse "It's just a demo/playtest" doesn't work here. I didn't test how optimized or buggy the game is, I only looked at the code itself. And it's a mess. It's a mess that I don't want to deal with.</p>
<p>Regarding modding tooling that Matt promises: that would be completely different from the modding we did with SoR1. Waiting until Matt adds support for something is very different from implementing the thing yourself. He's an only developer, and his hands are already full with just the base game.</p>
<p>And finally, for me personally, the most interesting thing about modding is creating something, that's vastly different from the original. Something weird, extrinsic, grand, silly, weird. For something of that degree of peculiarity, you'd at least have to make use of C#'s more advanced constructs. And Matt outright refuses to use any, other than classes, methods and fields.</p>
<p>If you want to mod SoR2, then good luck.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br>
<p>I've given it some thought, and decided to quit doing Streets of Rogue stuff.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-discontinue-roguelibs">Why discontinue RogueLibs?<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/discontinuing-roguelibs#why-discontinue-roguelibs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why discontinue RogueLibs?" title="Direct link to Why discontinue RogueLibs?">​</a></h2>
<p>A lot of factors contributed to this decision...<br>
<!-- -->For some background, you can read the <a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey"><em>"My Modding Journey"</em> blog post</a>.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Here's the list, in order from most to least significant:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of interest, and stagnancy.</strong> For 5 years now, I've focused all my efforts on Streets of Rogue. Almost everything I know is directly related to SoR. I need a change of pace. I want opportunities to learn other stuff, not related to SoR, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SoR's disgustingly awful code.</strong> I don't see many reasons to stick around with this kind of code any longer. I am so done with it, and I believe I deserve to work on stuff with better code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I feel overqualified for this.</strong> When I first started modding, SoR felt like a challenge. But now it's just an obstacle, stalling my growth, one that I would rather avoid instead of smashing through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissatisfaction with community management.</strong> To be honest, I had expected more involvement, more teasers and such, with more effort put into it. Other than the trailers, nothing really stood out. The disproportionate amount of hype I had for the sequel led to disappointment. And to be fair, that's on me, my expectations were too high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsibilities and stress.</strong> With the huge amount of issues and projects in progress, and no one else capable of handling them, it's getting rather stressful, and I really want some time for myself. And by that I don't mean just a small break, I mean finishing this chapter in my life, and moving forward. There's more to life, than just Streets of Rogue, after all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Arguably, some of these issues can be solved, but at that point it'd be more trouble than it's worth. Perhaps, I'll just find my happiness elsewhere. It can't be hard to find a place better than this.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="so-whats-gonna-happen">So, what's gonna happen?<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/discontinuing-roguelibs#so-whats-gonna-happen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So, what's gonna happen?" title="Direct link to So, what's gonna happen?">​</a></h2>
<p>I'll just stop working on SoR-related projects, and I'll archive their repositories. If you want to carry on the legacy, feel free to fork the repositories and continue working on these projects.</p>
<p>This documentation website and all currently released files and assets will remain available. The only exception is the newer beta of the website, the one at roguelibs.com, since it incurs some maintenance costs (web server, database, CMS, CDN, domain name). I'll wipe the data there and have it shut down. The <a href="https://github.com/Chasmical/roguelibs-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source repository</a> is still available, so feel free to host one yourself.</p>
<p>The official Discord server can carry on without me. The Russian Discord server, though, will probably bite the dust, unless someone stands up and continues managing the Russian community.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about more artistic and creative hobbies that I could try, such as art and writing. I&nbsp;have near-zero experience in both (I've only done simple pixel art and technical writing), but I&nbsp;guess we'll see how it works out.</p>
<p>As for programming, <em>"once a programmer, always a programmer!"</em> as they say.<br>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <span class="spoiler_pIvY"><span class="contents_Gk2H">Friction in the community made me realize that I don't actually care about Streets of Rogue.</span></span></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="blog-retrospective">Blog Retrospective<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey#blog-retrospective" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blog Retrospective" title="Direct link to Blog Retrospective">​</a></h2>
<p>It's been more than 2 years since the last post in this blog. Since then, my programming skills and knowledge have vastly improved, I've practiced a bit of technical writing, did some project management, web-development, learned several languages, and gotten familiar with more technical terms.</p>
<p>I've also reflected on the <a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor"><em>"What I hate about SoR"</em> post</a> and noted what I did wrong. There was too much critique, and not nearly enough examples to convey the full extent of how bad it is. I've pointed out problems, but poorly explained the reasons behind my proposed solutions. Sometimes the answers hid in the irony, and that's not something that should be in a constructive review.</p>
<p>I've considered writing a second part, <em>"What I hate about SoR. Part 2"</em>, where I would clearly document and explain all the issues in the game's code, but ended up not finishing it. Only 3 paragraphs worth of text (about 900 words), out of planned 20-30 paragraphs. Maybe all these pieces of advice will end up on my website at some point relatively far in the future.</p>

<p>Anyway, let's go back to the very beginning...</p>
<!-- -->
<p>It was year 2016, and a YouTuber that I grew up watching has retired and stopped making videos. But then, 2 years later he comes back, revives the channel, makes like a hundred more videos and, not even a year later, retires once again. Among the new videos there were ~10 hours worth of gameplay recorded by one of his friends playing some weird roguelike game. That's how I found Streets of Rogue.</p>
<p>At the time (2019), I was fascinated by the possibilities that the game offered.<br>
<!-- -->"You can play as a Doctor and still kill people?! WOW!"<br>
<!-- -->"There are 17 unique, distinct characters?! WOW."<br>
<!-- -->"You can make custom characters?! And there are stealth mechanics?! WOW!"<br>
<!-- -->"The humour in the [original] flavor texts meshes so well with the graphics and music!"<br>
<!-- -->"But... The Russian localization is crap."</p>
<p>That was the first time I used my very basic understanding of programming and computers in general for something useful. I examined the game files, found a Localization folder, read the instructions, fixed the translations, and uploaded it as a guide on Steam. Soon after, I was contacted by someone who wanted to help, we wrote several extensive Steam guides together, and then were invited to join the Russian SoR Discord server, led by Starinis – two Twitch streamers. They had multiple other games' communities on the same server, but I didn't give it much thought back then.</p>
<p>During my stay on Starinis' server, I learned JavaScript and created a modular multi-purpose Discord bot for their server's various needs. It could crosspost <abbr title="Russian equivalent of Twitter, basically" style="cursor:help;text-decoration:underline 1px dashed #888;text-underline-offset:3px">VKontakte</abbr> posts, notify about new YouTube videos and Twitch streams, play music in voice channels, and it had some fun commands. In parallel with this, I tried myself in game dev, but ended up only making a cool unique inventory system. At the time I didn't know about value and reference types, so, kinda makes sense why I didn't make it far.</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, I tried my hand at modding SoR and created ECTD. Half a year later I questioned the mod-making strategy of the time, and started the BepInEx/RogueLibs revolution in modding. Then, with a firm foundation in place, I made some mods (CustomAudioLoader, RogueLibs, aToM, aToI), and edited and published some videos about them. During 2020, I gained plenty of experience with C#, Unity, ECS, graphics, IL code and patching.</p>
<p>Remember Starinis, Russian SoR Discord admins, from a couple of paragraphs back? They suddenly decided to take away the channels dedicated to separate games, and put all communities in just one single channel. That day it became clear, that they were collecting game communities like pokemon, just to promote their own Twitch career. The SoR community and I had to revolt. We founded our own server, with lots of channels for all topics, and we've never heard from Starinis again.</p>
<p>In 2021, I got back to JavaScript, made this documentation website, and released RogueLibs v3, which would last for a while, and created a bunch of cool and more extensive mods. Then I noticed that my interest in SoR started fading... But I wasn't ready to drop Streets of Rogue completely, so instead I focused my efforts on a proper website for RogueLibs, with all kinds of stuff that the big websites have: authorization, dynamic pages, CMS, API, CDN. The design and styling were tough, and in addition to that, the university was taking its toll on me, so things were going very slowly.</p>
<p>In the middle of 2022, I dropped out of university. I waited for two entire years, hoping they would eventually get serious with the programming courses, but they never did – they stuck with basic constructs, arithmetics, structures and pointers, all of which I had already learned myself three years earlier. Then I got a remote job as a web-developer, and I haven't had much free time ever since.</p>

<p>Well, I guess, it all started with tinyBuild taking over SoR's community, in autumn of 2023. Due to some legal issues, they couldn't make the Russian Discord server official, and ended up creating 3 Russian channels on the official English server instead: #<em>rules</em>, #<em>general</em> and #<em>offtopic</em>. Predictably, everyone stayed on the Russian Discord server, but the existence of these 3 channels stumped the community's growth nonetheless.</p>
<p>I was a moderator on the official Discord server for about 4 months, but decided to leave, because I didn't like the amount of seemingly irresponsible shortcuts being taken, and I felt like my efforts would be better placed elsewhere. Strangely, the statement "Ignorance is bliss" seems to almost always apply to the backstage of SoR-related things: the code behind the game's mechanics, the markup behind the wiki, the management behind the community. And because I'm a perfectionist, that huge amount of little flaws and mistakes accumulated over time felt like an unliftable burden.</p>
<p>This friction made me rethink whether I want to be here at all. I reflected back on my past and realized that I don't have any sincere reason to be here anymore. I've lost interest in the game, and it feels like I've hit the ceiling, now stuck with SoR weighing me down, and unable to move forward.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Think carefully and critically of the programming courses in universities/colleges. Consider learning programming on your own, and make sure to do some research on what you'll learn during the courses. But most importantly, don't pay attention to the pretentious buzz words, look for specific knowledge instead. Let me list what some of the courses in my university had:</p>
<div style="font-size:0.9rem;margin:1rem 0"><ul>
<li>"AI and Logical programming" – basic binary logic and graphs. There's no AI <em><strong>or</strong></em> programming.</li>
<li>"Basics of Cryptography" – Caesar and Vigenere ciphers, and then some math tricks.</li>
<li>"Internet Culture" – some memes, political discussions and stuff about aggression on the web.</li>
<li>"Programming languages and transpiling" – writing simple programs in Assembler.</li>
<li>"Creating modern crossplatform web apps" – just basic HTML, JS and PHP, also, really outdated.</li>
<li>"Database technologies" – the very basics of MySQL, not even functions or indexes.</li>
<li>"Computer Graphics" – textures, shaders and shadows. I literally learned how to do that and more in the first day of me learning OpenGL! And they are stretching it all out over two entire semesters!</li>
<li>"Neural networks" – no nodes, no networks, just computing weird numbers, almost as if cracking hashes.</li>
<li>"Modern programming technologies" – solving purely geological problems for some reason.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>I'm not saying to completely disregard higher education though. It gives you more career opportunities, and may be a deciding factor when applying to a job, so take that into consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all hope is lost, you can find hope elsewhere. It's better to find something else that you like, than to see the thing dear to you sink to the very bottom and turn into the opposite of what it stood for. It will save you the heartbreak. Just persist, think carefully and do what you think is right.</p>
<p>I know, this advice sounds a bit cynical. But that's the bias you get by listening to a human being – their opinion is shaped by their experiences and thoughts. And those are <strong>my</strong> experiences and thoughts. Think about them and take them into consideration, but never dismiss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And lastly, don't underestimate your own subconciousness – when you learn the reasons behind your intuition, it may already be too late. For me, it often happens when coding – some part of the project suddenly feels off, but I can't understand why. Then, days or weeks later, I'd discover a fundamental flaw in the architectural design, directly related to that exact part that I doubted, forcing me to redo everything.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today RogueLibs v3.5.0 enters a long beta, because there's a huge list of stuff that needs to be done before the release, mainly adding new custom interactions without adding more patches. You'll be able to download the beta version on <a href="https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RogueLibs' releases page</a>.</p>
<p>Just like the localization system in v3.1.0, v3.5.0 will completely replace the vanilla interactions system. The original code in these places is absolutely awful and inconsistent. So, we'll have to rewrite every single vanilla interaction to be moddable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-code-is-really-hard-and-wet">The code is really hard and wet<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#the-code-is-really-hard-and-wet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The code is really hard and wet" title="Direct link to The code is really hard and wet">​</a></h2>
<p>.. Wait- No! I mean that the game is really <strong>hard</strong>coded! And the code is very <strong>WET</strong> - it's the opposite of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle... It's pretty funny to say that though.</p>
<p>So, anyways, I decided to make a list of things that I hate about modding Streets of Rogue:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="global-namespace">Global namespace<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#global-namespace" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Global namespace" title="Direct link to Global namespace">​</a></h3>
<p>The first annoying thing that you notice, when you take a brief look into SoR modding, is that all of the game's types are in the global namespace. There's a couple of exceptions, though that's probably from the copy-pasted code.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/HYDcvxx.png" alt="Global namespace (dnSpy)" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I mean, come on, just organize stuff in namespaces! Like <code>StreetsOfRogue</code> for main stuff, <code>StreetsOfRogue.LevelGeneration</code> for stuff related to level generation, <code>StreetsOfRogue.Objects</code> for all classes derived from <code>ObjectReal</code> and etc.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="a-lot-of-unused-types-and-members">A lot of unused types and members<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#a-lot-of-unused-types-and-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A lot of unused types and members" title="Direct link to A lot of unused types and members">​</a></h3>
<p>There's a lot of stuff, that's not used in the game at all. Some part of it is just some test code. The other part - is not related to Streets of Rogue at all, and probably was copy-pasted from somewhere else.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/XNeeF8Q.png" alt="A lot of unused types" class="img_ev3q">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/REhaTil.png" alt="3 unused fields in Agent class" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="bad-names">Bad names<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#bad-names" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bad names" title="Direct link to Bad names">​</a></h3>
<p><del>Type and member names should be descriptive. I do understand that Matt was the only one developing the game and didn't expect anyone to mess with the game's code. I also understand that you would know your own code better that anyone else, but still...</del> Although, nevermind, there's probably a ton of comments in the source code, that we can't see in the compiled assembly.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="too-many-string-comparisons">Too many string comparisons<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#too-many-string-comparisons" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Too many string comparisons" title="Direct link to Too many string comparisons">​</a></h3>
<p>After a couple of minutes of browsing through the code, you'll notice that there's way too many string comparisons. You know they're heavy on the performance. Sometimes they're in places where you don't even need strings, for example, in <code>Relationships</code> where you could have just used enumerations (actually, Matt used <strong>both</strong> enumerations and strings, for some weird reason).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="empty-strings">Empty strings<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#empty-strings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Empty strings" title="Direct link to Empty strings">​</a></h3>
<p>For some reason, <code>""</code> is used instead of <code>string.Empty</code>. And for some reason <code>""</code> in a lot of the code is equivalent to <code>null</code>. You know exactly what's wrong with that. In one case there <strong>is</strong> a string, that simply has zero length, in the other case - <strong>nothing</strong>, not even a string, just nothing. It's just plain wrong.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/9rDQAe7.png" alt="&quot;&quot; used instead of string.Empty or null" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="non-flexible-mechanics">Non-flexible mechanics<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#non-flexible-mechanics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Non-flexible mechanics" title="Direct link to Non-flexible mechanics">​</a></h3>
<p>For example, <code>Unlock</code> has three fields: <code>unavailable</code>, <code>onlyInCharacterCreation</code>, <code>freeItem</code>. How do you make something available only in Item Teleporter and not available anywhere else? Not only the fields are not descriptive, but they also function significantly differently - <code>unavailable</code> makes items unavailable anywhere, while <code>onlyInCharacterCreation</code> <em>apparently</em> makes an item available <strong>only</strong> in CC, and <code>freeItem</code> makes it available in Item Teleporter. You could have just named them <code>availableInGame</code>, <code>availableInCharacterCreation</code>, <code>availableInItemTeleporter</code>. Then their function and purpose is obvious.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/gjnxvNM.png" alt="unavailable, onlyInCharacterCreation and freeItem fields" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I spent <strong>dozens of hours</strong> converting that kind of system into something more maintainable: <code>Available</code>, <code>AvailableInCC</code> and <code>AvailableInItemTeleporter</code> - properties that you can find in RogueLibs. And even after that, <a href="https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there still were issues</a>. <em>I'm bad at discrete mathematics, that's why I had a hard time doing that.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hard-code">Hard code<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#hard-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hard code" title="Direct link to Hard code">​</a></h3>
<p>A lot of stuff in the game is so hardcoded, that it's almost impossible to add something completely new and unique. You'd have to modify code in a ton of places, even in places that you wouldn't even think to look in.<br>
<!-- -->I mean, why would you hardcode the amount of players in the game? Each player has a different field (<code>playerAgent</code>, <code>playerAgent2</code>, and so on). That's the only reason why creating a multiplayer game with more than 4 players is impossible.</p>

<p>I spent <strong>months</strong> trying to figure out how this fucking library works! There's no documentation on it. I mean, there are a couple of guides on how to use it in Unity Editor, but there's nothing on how it works internally. There are way too many unused classes, methods, properties and features, and for some reason the classes are in the global namespace. I'm surprised that Matt even figured out how to use it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="disregard-of-common-programming-principles">Disregard of common programming principles<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#disregard-of-common-programming-principles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Disregard of common programming principles" title="Direct link to Disregard of common programming principles">​</a></h3>
<p>A lot of methods have way too many instructions in them and sometimes they do stuff that you wouldn't expect them to do. Just split these different features into different methods.<br>
<strong>KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of methods have a lot of repeating code. You can put that repeating code in a separate method. That will save you a ton of time writing new methods, plus, the code will be easier to read.<br>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/bl0tEOj.png" alt="Comparison of raw binary data and XML-formatted file" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Why would you use binary serialization? It's completely unreadable!<br>

<p>Matt clearly doesn't understand the difference between reference and value types.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="lack-of-properties">Lack of properties<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#lack-of-properties" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lack of properties" title="Direct link to Lack of properties">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of constantly setting and updating fields' values in <code>Awake</code>, <code>Start</code> and other methods, you should just use properties. This way you won't have to constantly update fields' values, once you change one other field's value. The code will instantly become more maintainable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/gI7WV4I.png" alt="MyStart method sets up fields and is called in every other method" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="virtual-methods">Virtual methods<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#virtual-methods" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Virtual methods" title="Direct link to Virtual methods">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of putting dozens of empty virtual methods in a base class and overriding them in a couple of derived types, you should use interfaces! That's literally what they were created for.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/aKQA76v.png" alt="Empty virtual methods" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="lack-of-events">Lack of events<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#lack-of-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lack of events" title="Direct link to Lack of events">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of checking for conditions of doing something on every frame update, you should use events. That's literally what they were created for. As a bonus, there's no 1-frame delay, that you get from checking conditions every frame. And also, you know, checking event conditions every frame is a little bit excessive and definitely uses way too much CPU.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="giant-for-loops">Giant <code>for</code> loops<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor#giant-for-loops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to giant-for-loops" title="Direct link to giant-for-loops">​</a></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/kY8gtia.png" alt="A lot of really big and inefficient loops" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Why would you try to repeat the operation, if you know that the results will be exactly the same?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgur.com/vjCshb5.png" alt="An unnecessary for loop" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Why the hell would you write all of these giant <code>for</code> loops with a ton of conditions, <code>break</code>s and <code>continue</code>s and stuff like that, when there are already methods that do exactly that?<br>
<strong>Just use System.Linq extensions and List&lt;T&gt; methods!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today a new version of RogueLibs v3.1.0 was released!</p>
<p>A brand new localization system will completely replace the vanilla one!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fancy, easy-to-use XML files, for each language separately;</li>
<li>Fixed the bug with "E_" prefixes appearing in random places;</li>
<li>Custom languages support;</li>
<li>Community translations;</li>
<li>Automatic updates;</li>
<li>Live Reloading!</li>
</ul>

<p>On one hand, we lose some of th-, I mean, the <strong>one</strong> advantage of CSV files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small size.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Not as compact, as physically possible, but still, it has a relatively low data-to-size ratio, close to 1. The only non-data characters are commas, the surrounding quotes, double quotes inside of expressions and new lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>But on the other hand, we gain a ton of advantages of XML:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to read.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Humans can open the file in a text editor, and it will automatically highlight the XML syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to edit.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Modern text editors check for errors in XML, making it almost impossible to corrupt the file.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to parse.</strong><br>
<!-- -->Computers can easily parse XML files with the built-in <code>System.Xml.Serialization</code> (in case of C#). There's no need for any overcomplicated regular expressions used in the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="categorizing-translations-by-language">Categorizing translations by language<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/18/roguelibs-v3.1.0#categorizing-translations-by-language" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Categorizing translations by language" title="Direct link to Categorizing translations by language">​</a></h3>
<p>The vanilla game loads all languages at the same time, regardless of what language is selected.</p>
<p>RogueLibs will load only the ones, that are actually used: the selected one and the fallback one (default: English), that will be used in case an entry is missing in the selected language.</p>
<p>This loading strategy allows you to select from thousands of different localizations, without loading all of them at the same time.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="automatic-updates">Automatic updates<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/18/roguelibs-v3.1.0#automatic-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automatic updates" title="Direct link to Automatic updates">​</a></h3>
<p>When you launch the game, RogueLibs will download a small "index" file with some metadata, and then it will decide what translations should be updated. Don't worry, it won't check for updates too frequently, just once every hour.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="community-translations">Community translations<a href="https://chasmical.github.io/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/18/roguelibs-v3.1.0#community-translations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community translations" title="Direct link to Community translations">​</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of translations... <strong>The vanilla translations are terrible</strong>. I'm not sure what the situation is like with other languages, but russian localization is really bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some words are taken out of context. "Glass", as in "a glass wall", not as in "a glass of milk".</li>
<li>"Chunk Pack" was literally translated as a "pack" of "chunks". I'm not sure how to explain that, but it caused quite a lot of comotion in the russian community.</li>
<li>Some words are not translated at all. "Walkie-Talkie" is still a "Walkie-Talkie". What kind of translator were they even using? Every online translator I could find translated it correctly.</li>
<li>Some translation lines were shifted a couple of lines up or down, for some reason. As if someone was editing it in Excel.</li>
<li>There was also a ton of different styles. Sometimes "—" was used instead of "-", "…" instead of "..." and stuff like that. As if there were at least 3 different translators, one using Word, other one - Excel and another one - Notepad.</li>
<li>"Monkey Barrel" → "Обезьяна баррель". What the f***.</li>
<li>I spent about 2 days, working from morning to night, to fix all of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's why RogueLibs will use community translations instead of official ones.</p>
<p>Feel free to contribute by checking the localization files yourself and making any necessary changes. The localization files are located <a href="https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/tree/main/RogueLibsCore/Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in here</a>. See more info on contributing to the project <a href="https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you edit the localization files, the changes are reflected in the game immediately! Neat!</p>]]></content:encoded>
