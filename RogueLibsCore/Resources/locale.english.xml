    <Entry Id="Slavemaster">"The warmest, gentlest slavemaster one could ever hope to have.  Joins fellow Slavemasters each night to serenade their slaves with acapella lullabies.  This is followed by mandatory cuddle sessions.  As for all the form-fitting leather?.. Well, everybody has their thing, ok?"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Athlete">"When not administering wedgies, swirlies, and Indian sunburns to nerds, the Jock enjoys running into walls at high speeds.  When scientists contended that this behavior destroys brain cells, the Jock passionately argued that it actually RESTORES brain cells, ironically giving more validity to the scientists' claims.  Scientists backed down after receiving the most severe purple nurples of their lives."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Wrestler">"Manhandling, smashing, beating -- all in a day's work for the simple-minded but strong-of-heart Wrestler!  But in truth, this behavior stems from the Wrestler's severe frustrations with the world.  Why has the mayor banned playful roughhousing?  Why do so many businesses frown upon shirtlessness?  Why do books have all those stupid words in them?  AAARRRGH!!!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Vampire">"Sucks people's blood not out of absolute necessity, but is actually just a really picky eater.  This pickiness extends to the Vampire's social circles.  Recently overheard: ""Why does this zombie keep texting me to hang out?  It's like, dude, just cause we're both undead doesn't mean we're besties.  All you do is whine about politics."""</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Comedian">"Whether expounding on the differences between races or lamenting a recent online date gone hi-lariously bad, the Comedian has no shortage of worldview-expanding and totally non-hacky material.  While their jokes can be polarizing at times, the comedian lives to be loved, and won't be happy until everyone laughs DAMMIT!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Hacker">"Has ambitions of hacking the planet, but will realistically settle for your parents' webcam.  What Hacker worth their weight in salt doesn't want to take down the system?  Joining the Resistance was a no-brainer for this societal outcast.  Also no-brainers: Cheetos and not showering.  .....Stereotypes."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Bartender">"Everyone loves the friendly Bartender!  One of the few people willing to listen to you drone on about how your job is crap, the opposite sex doesn't like you, and you're thinking of 'ending it all in a rain of gunfire and carnage'.  Blah blah blah!  But the bartender remains understanding and discreet to their core.  Fun fact, the Bartender also serves alcohol."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Doctor">"One of the few true pacifists in this dangerous world.  Indeed, the Doctor is very skilled at 'pacifying' people.  With chloroform.  But business is currently booming, what with all the beating being administered by Cops since the Mayor's new ""Law of the Land"" was put in place.  Despite the extra cash flow, the Doctor would rather the streets be safe, and has decided to join the Resistance."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="ShapeShifter">"The Shapeshifter has been sent to Earth for the purpose of causing planet-wide chaos. Unfortunately, the Shapeshifter's earthly appearance is that of a demonic-looking little naked person (it's just pink eye, OK?), which is not really ideal for functioning in society. Fortunately, the Possession Stone allows the Shapeshifter to hop into and out of people's bodies, making life on Earth a whole lot easier!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Assassin">"Stealthily moves through the shadows and murders people from behind.  One day dreamed of assassinating a president or military leader, but has so far had to settle for rich old ladies and the occasional rich feline heir.  Hey, a job's a job!  When the Assassin heard about the growing unrest against the mayor, a murderous spirit within was renewed!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Cop">"Follows the Law of the Land unflinchingly, even if it doesn't always make perfect sense.  Despite this, the Cop became disenchanted with the current government after a law was passed preventing more than four people from dancing side by side, sadly forcing the Cop's Village People cover group to disband."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Cop2">"Follows the Law of the Land unflinchingly, even if it doesn't always make perfect sense.  Despite this, the Cop became disenchanted with the current government after a law was passed preventing more than four people from dancing side by side, sadly forcing the Cop's Village People cover group to disband."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Gangbanger">"Joined the Crepes after witnessing their father being murdered at the hands of a Blahd. Actually, it wasn't a Blahd, it was just a crazed naked man driven insane from a nasty sunburn. The Gangster probably needs to have their vision checked."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="GangbangerB">"Joined the Blahds after witnessing their father being murdered at the hands of a Crepe. Actually, it wasn't a Crepe, it was just a crazed naked man driven insane after falling into a vat of blueberries. The Gangster probably needs to have their vision checked."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Shopkeeper">"Is often known for being very critical of their fellow roguelike shopkeepers, referring to their contemporaries who set up shop in the middle of dungeons as ""frigging idiots with no common sense"".  Prefers to do business in populated areas that aren't surrounded by deadly monsters."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Soldier">"The Soldier aspires to fight for the city.  Unfortunately there are no wars going on right now.  So why not create one?  That's where the Resistance comes in.  Rather than sitting around twiddling their thumbs, the soldier will now have the opportunity to fight the good fight -- and maybe even commit a few atrocities in the process!  Hoo-ah!!!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Zombie">"The Zombie doesn't actually want to eat people's brains.  I mean, that's pretty gross.  However, society expects it. Society also demands that 'normies' try to stab Zombies in the head with an axe.  It's a vicious cycle.  Zombies also wish that they were cool enough to hang out with Vampires -- but as everyone knows, Vampires can be pretty aloof!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Businessman">"""Greed is good!  So are drugs!""  This is the motto that the Investment Banker lives by.  Predictably, this has led them to significant wealth and a crippling drug addiction...  Party party party!  It's an extreme lifestyle (and gameplay style) that's not for everyone."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Werewolf">"Up until this point, the Werewolf has only used their powers for two things: 1. Winning high school basketball games, and 2. Viciously mauling people.  Werewolf does not consider either of these things to be a worthwhile use of their time, and feels like their life is stuck in a rut.  Thanks to the Resistance, they'll hopefully be able to use their powers for some good -- all while having a howl-ingly good time!"</Entry>

    <Entry Id="Hobo">"Starting from nothing, the humble Slum Dweller is willing to rise up and do whatever it takes to make it in this crazy world.

    <Entry Id="Tut_ExitTutorial_5">"Oh, and by the way..."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Tut_ExitTutorial_6">Stay out of the occupied restrooms.  That kind of activity embarrasses the Resistance more than it does you.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Tut_ExitTutorial_7">Step into the Elevator to come join us in our Home Base.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro1">"So, I have a few other things to let you know before we send you out on the suicide miss- uhh, ""completely achievable"" mission of taking down the Mayor..."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro2">"FIRST: Since you're new to the city, you should know that it's built in vertical layers.  Like a lasagna."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro3">"Slums at the bottom, then the Industrial area, then the faux-outdoors Park, Downtown, and Uptown at the top."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro4">The only way to get from one level to the next is through elevators.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro5">"SECOND: In addition to your primary mission, we'll need you to do a bunch of other tasks for us."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro6">"They'll be highlighted on your map, like that Generator you just blew up."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro7">You'll need to finish your missions on a floor before you can travel to the next one.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro8">THIRD: Resistance Leaders like myself will help you out by sending you rewards for completing these missions.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro9">But that's about all we can do for you.  We're less 'doers' and more 'idea men'.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro10">"For example, it was my idea to send you out on this mission."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro11">"So do me proud, because there might be a promotion in it for me!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro12">"FOURTH: As you may know, the Mayor has banned Chicken Nuggets, due to the fact that they once caused him a mild tummy ache."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro13">Chicken Nuggets have since become a rare and precious commodity.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro14">"If you can scrounge up some Chicken Nuggets, we can trade 'em for things that can help you out."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro15">"The Doctor, Thief and Soldier can brief you a bit more on the Nugget situation."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro16">"Or if you want to head into the city, the Elevator is to your north."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_ResistanceLeader_Intro17">"Good luck to you, young rogue!"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="HB_Doctor_Intro1">"Bacon Cheeseburgers?  Oh, sorry..  I ate the last one while I was performing a long surgery."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Doctor_InteractHB_1">I know your body better than you do!...  That sounded weird...</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Soldier_InteractHB_1">I've got some cool gear for ya...</Entry>

    <Entry Id="Hacker_InteractHB_1">"I can literally hack the whole game, that's how l337 I am."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Scientist_InteractHB_1">Do you believe in alternate universes?  I can make one right now!</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Thief_InteractHB_1">I've been able to 'confiscate' some things for the Resistance...</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Gangbanger_InteractHB_1">"If you want other people to join you, I can help."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Zombie_InteractHB_1">Unghhhhhhh.</Entry>
    <Entry Id="WerewolfB_InteractHB_1">GRRRRRRRR!!!!!</Entry>
    <Entry Id="NA_InteractHB_1">Whatchu want?</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_1">"Once home to peace and prosperity, the city has fallen into the hands of a ruthless and dictatorial Mayor."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_2">"Elected on vague promises of ""lower taxes"" and ""more beer"", his true colors began to show immediately upon his inauguration."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_3">"The Mayor's first executive orders were a massive raise on taxes, and a one-time confiscation of all alcoholic beverages."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_4">"He stated that the confiscation was so he could throw ""the mother of all ragers"" for his constituents."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_5">"But in reality, there was only like one keg and a bag of tortilla chips."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Intro_6">It was suuuper lame.</Entry>

Examples: If you wanted something to have a 75% chance of spawning on all difficulty levels, you'd set the boxes to ""75, 0, 0"" or ""75, 75, 75"".  If you wanted something to have an 80% chance to spawn on difficulty 2 but NOT 3, you'd set it to ""0, 80, 0"".  If you want something to have a 50% chance to spawn on difficulty 2 but 100% on difficulty 3, you'd use ""0, 50, 100""."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_SpawnChance">"Chance to spawn, 0% to 100%."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_Important">"Objects and NPCs classified as ""Important"" can potentially be chosen for use in missions.  For example, a chest marked as ""Important"" might be used in a ""Retrieve Item"" mission.  An imprisoned person marked as ""Important"" might be chosen for a ""Rescue"" mission.  An owner marked as important might be chosen for a ""Neutralize"" mission.  NPCs marked as ""Important"" might also become questgivers."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_OwnerID">"Numeric value indicating ownership.  Any objects, walls or floors with a matching ""Owned By"" ID will be owned by this NPC.  An NPC with an Owner ID of 99 will treat all owned property in the chunk as their own."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_OwnedByID">"Numeric value indicating ownership.  Any NPC with a matching ""Owner ID"" will own this.  Objects and walls will automatically take the ID of the floor below them, unless a new owner is specified for that object."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_WallSpawnSometimes">"Walls marked with this will have a 50% chance of spawning, even when they have the same ""Multiple in Chunk"" ID as other nearby walls"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_MultipleInChunkID">"Numeric value.  Objects with matching IDs will spawn ""the same"" as all other objects with this ID.  For example, if you chose ""Strong Walls"" as your wall type (which chooses randomly between the wall types ""Normal"" and ""Steel""), and you placed a bunch of walls WITHOUT a ""Multiple in Chunk"" ID, some of your walls would be Normal, and some would be Steel.  On the other hand, if you gave the walls a matching ""Multiple in Chunk"" ID, all of the walls would spawn as Normal, or all would spawn as Steel."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_PrisonID">"""Prisons"" are essentially any area on owned property where the player is not allowed to go.  The numeric ""Prison ID"" value can be placed on any of the different floor layers.  Values higher than 0 indicate that the floor tile is a prison.  Floor tiles underneath the surrounding prison walls should be given a prison ID.  If a chunk has multiple prisons, be sure to give different Prison IDs to the floor tiles for each prison."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_Layer">"Numeric value from 0 to 2 showing the layer of the floor tile.  You could technically have a tile with ""Layer 2"" on ""Floor 1"", but you should probably keep these to their default values to avoid confusion."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_Direction">"Direction the object is facing.  Defaults to South, but objects next to walls will often automatically face the correct direction if left blank."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_OneOfEachID">"Alphanumeric value.  If you only want an object to appear once on an entire level, give a matching value to every object of this type in every chunk.  When the level loads, only one of those objects will appear."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_DefaultGoal">"Starting goal for an NPC.  If left blank, the game will choose an appropriate goal based on the NPC's circumstances."</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_ProtectsProperty">"""None"" means a person won't care if you enter their property.  ""Hostile"" will cause them to become hostile when you enter.  A value of 2 will cause them to tell you to leave, but they won't immediately become hostile. (NPCs will always be hostile if you enter their owned Prison tiles)"</Entry>
    <Entry Id="Help_PatrolPoint">"Numeric value determining the numbered order of a Patrol Point.  For example, an NPC would walk from a Patrol Point with value 1, to 2, to 3, etc.  Upon reaching the end of the sequence, the NPC walks back to the point with value 1."</Entry>
