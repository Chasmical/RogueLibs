# Introduction

So, you want to create a cool-looking website for your mod/plugin?

In this tutorial we'll be using Docusaurus, and we'll be deploying the site using GitHub Pages.

:::info
You can follow the Docusaurus instructions [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/installation), or you can use the template below.
:::

## Using the template {#using-my-template}

This template is like the default `classic`, but without any unnecessary stuff.

[Download the template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18jw5SKAGdxes-WKaze3n44x98Inn8Ksh/view?usp=sharing) and extract the `website` folder into your solution's folder.

You'll see a file called `[[PROJECT-NAME]] (website).code-workspace` in the `website` directory.  
Replace `[[PROJECT-NAME]]` with the name of your project.

Then open that workspace file, go to Search and replace the following in all files:

- `[[PROJECT-NAME]]` - the name of your project.
- `[[USERNAME]]` - your username on GitHub.
- `[[REPOSITORY]]` - your project's repository name on GitHub.
- `[[MAIN-BRANCH]]` - your repository's default branch (`master` or `main`).
- `[[LOGO-ALT-TEXT]]` - `alt` text, describing your logo.
- `[[EMAIL]]` - your e-mail (required for the workflow).

Also replace the images in `static/img`: `favicon.ico`, `logo.png` and `logo-dark.png`. ([.ico converter](https://convertio.co/ico-converter))

Then move the `.github` directory up one level, so it's in the root of your repository and push the changes.

## Deploying the website {#deploying-website}

:::note
I find [Docusaurus docs on that](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/deployment#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions) a little bit confusing, so here's my version of these instructions.
:::

### Generate a SSH key {#generate-ssh-key}
1. Open the command line and generate a SSH key:
  `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "[[EMAIL]]"`;
2. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location;
3. When you're prompted to "Enter a passphrase," press Enter (no passphrase);
4. When you're prompted to repeat the passphrase, press Enter again;

You'll find the keys in your profile's directory (`C:\Users\[[UserName]]\.ssh` or `~/.ssh`).

### Create a deploy key on GitHub {#create-deploy-key}
1. Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings > Deploy Keys > Add deploy key**;
2. Paste the contents of the `id_ed25519.pub` file;
3. Check the "Allow write access" box;
4. Save (the key's name doesn't matter, you can call it `DeployKey1` or something like that);

### Create a GitHub secret {#create-secret}
1. Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings > Secrets > New repository secret**;
2. Paste the contents of the `id_ed25519` file;
3. Call the secret `GH_PAGES_DEPLOY`;
4. Save your secret;

### Trigger the workflow {#trigger-workflow}
1. Push the website to the repository, if you didn't already;
2. Go to your GitHub repository's **Actions > documentation.yml**;
3. If the workflow didn't trigger on its own, start it.

:::note
If there aren't any errors, the website will be deployed at `[[USERNAME]].github.io/[[REPOSITORY]]/`.  
If there are errors, you'll see them in the details of the workflow run.

## Adding components {#adding-components}

Clone or download the RogueLibs' repository and copy-paste the components from there into your website.

Components probably won't be versioned, so you'll have to look for updates yourself.
