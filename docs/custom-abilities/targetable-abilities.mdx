# Targetable Abilities

Custom abilities can be made targetable by implementing the `IAbilityTargetable` interface. You can determine the target of the special ability (for example, the closest agent), and a special ability indicator will be displayed over it. Then you'll be able to access the determined target through the `CurrentTarget` property.

## Making abilities targetable {#iabilitytargetable}

Just implement the `IAbilityTargetable` interface in your ability's class:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyTargetableAbility.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyTargetableAbility : CustomAbility, IAbilityTargetable
{
    // highlight-next-line
    public PlayfieldObject FindTarget() { /* ... */ }
}
```

`FindTarget` determines the closest (or the most compatible/applicable) target, that the ability can be used on right now. If the ability cannot be used right now, you should return `null`. Then, you can use `CurrentTarget` in any of the methods:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyTargetableAbility.cs"
    public override void OnPressed()
    {
        if (CurrentTarget is null)
        {
            gc.audioHandler.Play(Owner, "CantDo");
            return;
        }
        /* ... */
    }
```
