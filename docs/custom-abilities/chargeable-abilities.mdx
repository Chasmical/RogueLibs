# Chargeable Abilities

Custom abilities can be made chargeable by implementing the `IAbilityChargeable` interface. Ability's `Count` here works as the amount of stored up energy/charges. This interface makes use of some of the game's charging mechanics, but it doesn't completely rely on it. I'd recommend taking a look at [Rechargeable Items](../custom-items/rechargeable-items), if you need finer control.

## Making abilities chargeable {#iabilitychargeable}

Just implement the `IAbilityChargeable` interface in your ability's class:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyChargeableAbility.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyChargeableAbility : CustomAbility, IAbilityChargeable
{
    // highlight-start
    public void OnHeld(AbilityHeldArgs e) { /* ... */ }
    public void OnReleased(AbilityReleasedArgs e) { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```

`OnHeld` is called every frame *(I think?)* that the special ability button is held. `OnReleased` is called on the frame that the special ability button is released. Use these in tandem with `OnPressed` to charge your ability and stuff.

:::caution
`AbilityHeldArgs.Interrupt()` method is still work-in-progress.
