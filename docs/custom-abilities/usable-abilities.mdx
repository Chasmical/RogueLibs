# Usable Abilities

Custom abilities are by default usable (otherwise, how would you use them?). As you saw on the previous documentation page, `CustomAbility` class already provides you with everything you would need to make a simple usable ability. Just override the `OnAdded` and `OnPressed` methods. There's not much to say. It's just that simple.

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyUsableAbility.cs"
public class MyUsableAbility : CustomAbility
{
    // highlight-start
    public override void OnAdded() { /* ... */ }
    public override void OnPressed() { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```
