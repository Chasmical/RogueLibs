# Hook Factories

**Hook factories** are responsible for the creation of hooks. Custom content classes use hook factories internally, so there's basically no need for you to create your own. But, if you want to semi-automate the creation of a lot of different items/traits with slightly differing functionality, you can create a class, that will handle everything, and turn its parts on/off conditionally after initializing the hook.

## `IHookFactory` interface {#ihookfactory}

You can create hook factories by deriving either from `IHookFactory` or from `HookFactoryBase<T>`. The hook factory in the example below will attach a new `MyCustomHook` hook to all items that have a "Food" category:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHookFactory.cs"
public class MyAwesomeHookFactory : HookFactoryBase<InvItem>
{
    public override bool TryCreate(InvItem instance, out IHook<InvItem> hook)
    {
        if (instance.Categories.Contains("Food"))
        {
            hook = new MyAwesomeHook();
            return true;
        }
        hook = null;
        return false;
    }
}
```

:::caution
You only need to create a hook object. **DO NOT** attach it to the instance! That's the external code's responsibility.

```csharp title="/RogueLibsCore/Patches/Patches_Items.cs"
foreach (IHookFactory factory in RogueFramework.ItemFactories)
{
    IHook? hook = factory.TryCreateHook(__instance);
    if (hook is not null) controller.AddHook(hook);
}
```
:::

## Initialization {#initialization}

You can either implement your own way of using factories or add it to the RogueLibs' `RogueFramework` class:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHookFactory.cs"
[RLSetup]
public static void Setup()
{
    RogueFramework.ItemFactories.Add(new MyAwesomeHookFactory());
}
```

## Examples {#examples}

RogueLibs uses `CustomItemFactory` and other similar classes to initialize custom items and other hooks:

```csharp title="/RogueLibsCore/Hooks/Items/CustomItemFactory.cs"
public sealed class CustomItemFactory : HookFactoryBase<InvItem>
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, ItemEntry> itemsDict = new Dictionary<string, ItemEntry>();

    public override bool TryCreate(InvItem? instance, [NotNullWhen(true)] out IHook<InvItem>? hook)
    {
        if (instance?.invItemName != null && itemsDict.TryGetValue(instance.invItemName, out ItemEntry entry))
        {
            hook = entry.Initializer();
            if (hook is CustomItem custom)
                custom.Metadata = entry.Metadata;
            return true;
        }
        hook = null;
        return false;
    }

    public CustomItemMetadata AddItem<TItem>() where TItem : CustomItem, new()
    {
        CustomItemMetadata metadata = CustomItemMetadata.Get<TItem>();
        itemsDict.Add(metadata.Name, new ItemEntry { Initializer = static () => new TItem(), Metadata = metadata });
        return metadata;
    }

    private struct ItemEntry
    {
        public Func<IHook<InvItem>> Initializer;
        public CustomItemMetadata Metadata;
    }
}
```

```csharp title="/RogueLibsCore/Patches/Patches_Items.cs"
public static void InvItem_SetupDetails(InvItem __instance)
{
    foreach (IHookFactory factory in RogueFramework.ItemFactories)
    {
        IHook? hook = factory.TryCreateHook(__instance);
        if (hook is not null) controller.AddHook(hook);
    }
}
```
