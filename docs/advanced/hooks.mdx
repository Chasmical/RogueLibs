# Hooks

A **hook** is an object that is attached to another object ("hook" is a really vague word, jsyk). In RogueLibs hook types derive from `IHook` and `IHook<T>`, and RogueLibs provides a mechanism to attach these hooks to vanilla types, such as `InvItem`, `PlayfieldObject`, `Unlock`, `Trait` and etc. Most custom content classes are based on hooks in one way or another.

## `IHook` interface {#ihook}

RogueLibsPatcher.dll creates fields called `__RogueLibsHooks` in all hookable types. An instance of `IHookController` class is then assigned to the `__RogueLibsHooks` field to manage the attached hooks. It provides methods to get, attach and detach hooks from the current instance. Think of it as a collection of hooks.

You can create your own hooks by deriving either from `IHook<T>` or from `HookBase<T>`:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHook.cs"
public class MyAwesomeHook : HookBase<InvItem>
{
    private string Data;

    protected override void Initialize() { }

    public void StoreInfo(string data)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Stored {data}.");
        Data = data;
    }
    public string LoadInfo()
    {
        Debug.Log($"Loaded {Data}.");
        return Data;
    }
}
```

## Usage {#usage}

You can use hooks to store various stuff:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHook.cs"
MyAwesomeHook hook = item.AddHook<MyAwesomeHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-information");
```

Then you can use that stuff somewhere else:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHook.cs"
MyAwesomeHook? hook = item.GetHook<MyAwesomeHook>();
if (hook != null)
{
    string data = hook.LoadInfo();
}
```

You can attach more than one hook of a type too:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHook.cs"
MyAwesomeHook hook = item.AddHook<MyAwesomeHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-information");
hook = item.AddHook<MyAwesomeHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-other-stuff");
hook = item.AddHook<MyAwesomeHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("something-else");
```

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeHook.cs"
foreach (MyAwesomeHook hook in item.GetHooks<MyAwesomeHook>())
{
    string data = hook.LoadInfo();
}
```

:::tip{title="Pro-tip: Hook Factories"}
If you want to attach hooks to instances right when they are initialized, use [Hook Factories](./hook-factories).

## Examples {#examples}

:::info
Custom content classes (`CustomItem`, `CustomTrait`, `CustomEffect`, `CustomAbility` and others) are hooks, by the way. You can see the custom classes' implementation in [RogueLibs' source code](https://github.com/SugarBarrel/RogueLibs/tree/main/RogueLibsCore/Hooks).
