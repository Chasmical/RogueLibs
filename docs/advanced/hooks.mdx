# Hooks

A **hook** is an object that is attached to another object ("hook" is a really vague word, jsyk). In RogueLibs hook types derive from `IHook` and `IHook<T>`, and RogueLibs provides a mechanism to attach these hooks to vanilla types, such as `InvItem`, `PlayfieldObject`, `Unlock`, `Trait` and etc. Most custom content classes are based on hooks in one way or another.

import Tabs from '@site/src/components/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@site/src/components/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

## `IHook` interface {#ihook}

RogueLibsPatcher.dll creates fields called `__RogueLibsHooks` in all hookable types. An instance of `IHookController` class is then assigned to the `__RogueLibsHooks` field to manage the attached hooks. It provides methods to get, attach and detach hooks from the current instance. Think of it as a collection of hooks.

You can create your own hooks by deriving either from `IHook<T>` or from `HookBase<T>`:

```csharp title="MyCustomHook.cs"
public class MyCustomHook : HookBase<InvItem>
{
    protected override void Initialize() { }
    
    public void StoreInfo(string data)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Stored {data}.");
        Data = data;
    }
    public string LoadInfo()
    {
        Debug.Log($"Loaded {Data}.");
        return Data;
    }
    private string Data;
}
```

## Usage {#usage}

You can use hooks to store various stuff:

```csharp
MyCustomHook hook = item.AddHook<MyCustomHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-information");
```

Then you can use that stuff somewhere else:

```csharp
MyCustomHook hook = item.GetHook<MyCustomHook>();
if (hook != null)
{
    string data = hook.LoadInfo();
}
```

You can attach more than one hook of a type too:

```csharp
MyCustomHook hook = item.AddHook<MyCustomHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-information");
hook = item.AddHook<MyCustomHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("some-other-stuff");
hook = item.AddHook<MyCustomHook>();
hook.StoreInfo("something-else");
```

```csharp
foreach (MyCustomHook hook in item.GetHooks<MyCustomHook>())
{
    string data = hook.LoadInfo();
}
```

:::tip Pro-tip: Hook Factories
If you want to attach hooks to instances right when they are initialized, use [Hook Factories](./hook-factories).

## Examples {#examples}

:::info
Custom content classes (`CustomItem`, `CustomTrait`, `CustomEffect`, `CustomAbility` and others) are hooks, by the way. You can see the custom classes' implementation in [RogueLibs' source code](https://github.com/SugarBarrel/RogueLibs/tree/main/RogueLibsCore/Hooks).

import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/components/CodeSnippet';

import SpiceRack from '!!raw-loader!@site/../RogueLibsCore.Test/Tests/Items/SpiceRack.cs';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="spicerack"
    values={[
        {label:'Spice Rack', value:'spicerack'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="spicerack">

A great example with custom hooks keeping track of seasoned items.

See the combinable item example [here](../items/combinable-items#examples).
