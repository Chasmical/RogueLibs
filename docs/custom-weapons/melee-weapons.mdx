# Melee Weapons

Melee weapons are realy complicated. But, thankfully, RogueLibs takes care of the most difficult part — patching. So, all you have to do is to create a class deriving from `CustomWeaponMelee`. I've spent hundreds of hours patching the melee weapons code, and managed to condense all of it into a single class. It's ridiculous how overcomplicated and wet Matt's code is.
