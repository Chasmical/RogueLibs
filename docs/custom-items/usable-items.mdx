# Usable Items

Custom items can be made usable by implementing the `IItemUsable` interface, that defines a single method, `UseItem`. Usable items can be used by right-clicking them in the inventory, or using them from the toolbar (1-5 keys).

## Making items usable {#making-usable}

Just implement the `IItemUsable` interface in your item's class:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyUsableItem.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyUsableItem : CustomItem, IItemUsable
{
    // highlight-next-line
    public bool UseItem() { /* ... */ }
}
```

`UseItem`'s return value indicates whether the item was successfully used. Returning `true` will also play an animation. When returning `false`, you can play a `"CantDo"` sound, and optionally make the current owner say why the item cannot be used:

```csharp
        if (cantUse)
        {
            gc.audioHandler.Play(Owner, "CantDo");
            Owner.SayDialogue("CantUseItemBecause...");
            // don't forget to create a dialogue with that id
            return false;
        }
```

:::info
You're responsible for decrementing the item's `Count`. So, don't forget to do that.

## Examples {#examples}

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Joke Book">

A simple usable item that allows the player to use the Joke ability.

{/* <CodeSnippet>{JokeBook}</CodeSnippet> */}

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Adrenaline Shot">

A simple usable item that gives the player an effect called "Adrenaline". You can see Adrenaline effect's implementation in [Creating a Custom Effect: Examples](../traits/create-effect#examples).

{/* <CodeSnippet>{AdrenalineShot}</CodeSnippet> */}

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Wild Bypasser">

A more complicated usable item, based on Wall Bypasser's code (see `ItemFunctions.UseItem`).

{/* <CodeSnippet>{WildBypasser}</CodeSnippet> */}

</TabItem>
