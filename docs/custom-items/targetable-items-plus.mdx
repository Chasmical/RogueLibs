# Targetable Items +

Custom items can be made targetable+ (targetable anywhere) by implementing the `IItemTargetableAnywhere`. Normal targetable items can only be used on something actually present in the game, but as that parenthesised text implies, targetable+ items can be used anywhere on the screen. And so, this interface uses in-game positions instead of objects.

## Making items targetable anywhere {#iitemtargetableanywhere}

Just implement the `IItemTargetableAnywhere` interface in your item's class:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyTargetableAnywhereItem.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyTargetableAnywhereItem : CustomItem, IItemTargetableAnywhere
{
    // highlight-start
    public bool TargetFilter(Vector2 position) { /* ... */ }
    public bool TargetPosition(Vector2 position) { /* ... */ }
    public CustomTooltip TargetCursorText(Vector2 position) { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```

`TargetFilter` determines where the cursor should be highlighted, when using the current item.

`TargetPosition` uses the current item on the position. The return value indicates whether it was a success or not. You can play a `"CantDo"` sound and make the player say something, if the item cannot be used. Returning `true` will also play an animation.

`TargetCursorText` determines the text under the cursor when hovering over the specified position. `Text` set to `null` will default to "Use", and `Color` set to `null` will default to `#FFFFFF`.
