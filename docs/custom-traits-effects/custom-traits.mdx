# Creating a Custom Trait

RogueLibs provides classes and methods to create custom traits, and an interface to make traits updateable. Just like items, custom traits derive from a hook class, `CustomTrait`, and their functionality can be expanded with interfaces: `ITraitUpdateable`, just one in this case. If you want the trait to have some kind of a passive effect, then you might need to patch that in yourself.

## `CustomTrait` class {#customtrait}

To make a custom trait, you need to create a class deriving from `CustomTrait`:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait
{
    /* ... */
}
```

There are 2 methods that you need to implement:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait
{
    // highlight-start
    public override void OnAdded() { /* ... */ }
    public override void OnRemoved() { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```

`OnAdded` is called when the trait is added to a character, and `OnRemoved` is called when it's removed from a character.

## Updating {#updating}

You can make your trait updateable by implementing the `ITraitUpdateable` interface:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait, ITraitUpdateable
{
    public void OnUpdated(TraitUpdatedArgs e) { /* ... */ }
}
```

`OnUpdated` works like Unity's `Update`, but with a settable interval (default is 1 second):

```csharp
    public void OnUpdated(TraitUpdatedArgs e)
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        e.UpdateDelay = 0.5f; // 2 updates per second
        /* ... */
    }
```

## Initialization {#initialization}

Just call the `CreateCustomTrait` method with your trait's type as a parameter:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomTrait<MyCustomTrait>();
    }
}
```

:::note
See more about the `RLSetup` attribute [here](../misc/utilities#rlsetup).
:::

You can set your trait's name and description using `WithName` and `WithDescription` methods:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomTrait<MyCustomTrait>()
            // highlight-start
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Trait"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Trait is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"));
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

You can do the same with sprites and unlocks:

```csharp title="MyCustomTrait.cs"
public class MyCustomTrait : CustomTrait
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomTrait<MyCustomTrait>()
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Trait"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Trait is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"))
            // highlight-start
            // the sprite will be displayed only in the menus (optional)
            .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomTrait)
            .WithUnlock(new TraitUnlock { UnlockCost = 10, CharacterCreationCost = 5 });
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

## Unlock Properties {#unlock-properties}

You can use the following properties when initializing `TraitUnlock`s:

Property                | Default | Description
------------------------|---------|------------
`UnlockCost`            | `0`     | Unlock cost of the trait, in nuggets. If set to 0, it will unlock automatically, once all prerequisites are unlocked.
`CharacterCreationCost` | `1`     | Cost of the trait in Character Creation, in points.
`IsAvailable`           | `true`  | Determines whether the trait is available in the Traits menu and on level-ups. If the trait is negative, set it to `false`.
`IsAvailableInCC`       | `true`  | Determines whether the trait is available in the Character Creation menu.
`Cancellations`         |         | Determines what traits cannot co-exist with this trait.
`Prerequisites`         |         | Determines what unlocks must be unlocked in order to unlock this trait.
`Recommendations`       |         | Just shows these unlocks in a separate Recommendations paragraph in the menus.

Other properties should not be used during initialization.
