# Creating a Custom Effect

RogueLibs provides classes and methods to create custom effects, and an interface to make status effects updateable. Just like items and traits, custom effects derive from a hook class, `CustomEffect`. If you want the effect to have some kind of a passive effect, then you might need to patch that in yourself.

## `CustomEffect` class {#customeffect}

To make a custom effect, you need to create a class deriving from `CustomEffect`:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyAwesomeEffect : CustomEffect
{
    /* ... */
}
```

There are 5 methods that you need to implement:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
public class MyAwesomeEffect : CustomEffect
{
    // highlight-start
    public override int GetEffectTime() { /* ... */ }
    public override int GetEffectHate() { /* ... */ }
    public override void OnAdded() { /* ... */ }
    public override void OnRemoved() { /* ... */ }
    public override void OnUpdated(EffectUpdatedArgs e) { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```

`GetEffectTime` determines the default status effect time. Traits like "Longer Status Effects", "Longer Status Effects +" and "Shorter Status Effects" are applied after calling this method.

`GetEffectHate` determines how much hate other characters will get towards the character who inflicted the status effect on them. Usually, it's 5 for negative effects and 0 for positive effects.

:::caution
`GetEffectTime` and `GetEffectHate` are called on partially initialized hooks, so the effect's owner might not actually have the effect. Do not initialize any effect-specific variables in these methods.
:::

`OnAdded` is called when the effect is added to a character, and `OnRemoved` is called when it's removed from a character.

`OnUpdated` works like Unity's `Update`, but with a settable interval (default is 1 second):

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
    public override void OnUpdated(EffectUpdatedArgs e)
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        e.UpdateDelay = 0.5f; // 2 updates per second
        /* ... */
        // highlight-next-line
        CurrentTime--;
    }
```

:::info
You're responsible for decrementing the effect's `CurrentTime`. So, don't forget to do that.
:::

All custom effect classes should have an `EffectParameters` attribute. You can specify whether your effect should be removed on death, on knockout or between levels. Default is `RemoveOnDeath`.

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
[EffectParameters(EffectLimitations.RemoveOnDeath | EffectLimitations.RemoveOnKnockOut)]
public class MyAwesomeEffect : CustomEffect
{
    /* ... */
}
```

## Initialization {#initialization}

Just call the `CreateCustomEffect` method with your effect's type as a parameter:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
public class MyAwesomeEffect : CustomEffect
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomEffect<MyAwesomeEffect>();
    }
}
```

:::note
See more about the `RLSetup` attribute [here](../misc/utilities#rlsetup).
:::

You can set your effect's name and description using `WithName` and `WithDescription` methods:

```csharp title="/MyAwesomeProject/MyAwesomeEffect.cs"
public class MyAwesomeEffect : CustomEffect
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomEffect<MyAwesomeEffect>()
            // highlight-start
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Awesome Effect"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Awesome Effect is very cool and does a lot of great stuff, and it's also awesome."));
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

## Examples {#examples}

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Adrenaline">

A simple effect that just gives a temporary boost to some stats. You can see Adrenaline Shot's (item that gives this effect) implementation in [Usable Items: Examples](../custom-items/usable-items#examples).
