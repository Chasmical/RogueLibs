# Creating a Custom Disaster

You can create your own custom disasters using a `CustomDisaster` class, provided by RogueLibs. You can configure the disaster's name, description and both of the messages that are displayed at the beginning of the floor. And, of course, you can determine the conditions that the disaster can (or must) happen under, and what happens at the start of and during this disaster. Additionally, you can quickly and easily create a removal mutator that removes your disaster from the pool.

## `CustomDisaster` class {#customdisaster}

To make a custom disaster, you need to create a class deriving from `CustomDisaster`:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
// highlight-next-line
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    /* ... */
}
```

There are 3 methods that you need to implement:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    // highlight-start
    public override void Start() { /* ... */ }
    public override void Finish() { /* ... */ }
    public override IEnumerator? Updating() { /* ... */ }
    // highlight-end
}
```

`Start` is called when the disaster starts. `Finish` is called when the disaster ends.

:::caution `Start` and `Finish` methods
These methods are called between levels, so some stuff might not be available at the time they're called.
:::

`Updating` returns the updating coroutine for the disaster. It starts **after the disaster's notification**. It is stopped automatically, when the disaster ends. If your disaster doesn't need updating, you can just return `null`.

## Disaster Conditions {#disaster-conditions}

If you want your disaster to appear only under certain conditions, override the `Test` method:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    // highlight-start
    public override bool Test()
    {
        // for example, if it's a Park level
        return CurrentDistrict == 2;
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

:::info

`CustomDisaster` exposes several useful properties for that:
- `CurrentDistrict` - index of the current level's district.
  *(`0` - Slums, `1` - Industrial, `2` - Park, `3` - Downtown, `4` - Uptown, `5` - Mayor Village)*
- `CurrentFloor` - index of the current level's floor of the district.
  *(`0`, `1` or `2` in a normal playthrough, and `0` or `1` with "Quick Game" mutator on)*
- `CurrentLevel` - index of the current level.
  *(`0-2` - Slums, `3-5` - Industrial, `6-8` - Park, `9-11` - Downtown, `12-14` - Uptown, `15` - Mayor Village)*
  *(or `0-1`, `2-3`, `4-5`, `6-7`, `8-9`, `10` if Quick Game is on), and more in Endless mode)*

:::

And, if you want to force your disaster onto a level, override the `TestForced` method.

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    // highlight-start
    public override bool TestForced()
    {
        // for example, if there's a Mayor on the level
        return gc.agentList.Exists(a => a.agentName === VanillaAgents.Mayor);
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

:::caution Current limitations
At the moment, `TestForced` cannot force a disaster onto a non-disastrous level. It only works on levels that normally have disasters: \*-3 (or \*-2 with Quick Game on), or every level with the Disasters Every Level mutator.
:::

## Disaster Settings {#disaster-settings}

Normally, you can't teleport during disasters, but you can change that by overriding the `AllowTeleport` property:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    // highlight-start
    public override bool AllowTeleport => true;
    // highlight-end
}
```

The property is accessed constantly, so you can change the return value with time.

## Initialization {#initialization}

Just call the `CreateCustomDisaster` method with your disaster's type as a parameter:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomDisaster<MyCustomDisaster>();
    }
}
```

:::note
See more about the `RLSetup` attribute [here](../misc/utilities#rlsetup).
:::

You can set your disaster's name and description using `WithName` and `WithDescription` methods:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomDisaster<MyCustomDisaster>()
            // highlight-start
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"));
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

Plus, you can add two messages (they are displayed at the same time, on two lines):

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomDisaster<MyCustomDisaster>()
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"))
            // highlight-start
            .WithMessage(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster!"))
            .WithMessage(new CustomNameInfo("Watch out for... uh, something dangerous!"));
            // highlight-end
    }
}
```

:::info
See [Custom Names](../names/custom-names) for more info.

You can also create a removal mutator automatically:

```csharp title="MyCustomDisaster.cs"
public class MyCustomDisaster : CustomDisaster
{
    [RLSetup]
    public static void Setup()
    {
        RogueLibs.CreateCustomDisaster<MyCustomDisaster>()
            .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster"))
            .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster is very cool and does a lot of great stuff"))
            .WithMessage(new CustomNameInfo("My Custom Disaster!"))
            .WithMessage(new CustomNameInfo("Watch out for... uh, something dangerous!"))
            // highlight-next-line
            .WithRemovalMutator();
    }
}
```

## Examples {#examples}

import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/components/CodeSnippet';

import NewHealthOrder from '!!raw-loader!@site/../RogueLibsCore.Test/Tests/Disasters/NewHealthOrder.cs';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="newhealthorder"
    values={[
        {label:'New Health Order', value:'newhealthorder'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="newhealthorder">

A simple disaster that just gives everyone Resurrection after the notification.

<CodeSnippet>{NewHealthOrder}</CodeSnippet>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
