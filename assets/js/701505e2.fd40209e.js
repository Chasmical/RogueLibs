Practically everything I know is directly related to SoR. I need a change of pace. I want opportunities to learn other stuff, not related to SoR, as well.\\n\\n2. **SoR\'s disgustingly awful code.** I don\'t see many reasons to stick around with this kind of code any longer. With my self-esteem now back to normal levels, I believe I deserve to work with better code.\\n\\n3. **Dissatisfaction with community management.** To be honest, I had expected more involvement, more teasers and such, with more effort put into it. Other than the trailers, nothing really stood out. The disproportionate amount of hype I had for the sequel led to disappointment. And to be fair, that\'s on me, my expectations were too high.\\n\\n4. **Responsibilities and stress.** With the huge amount of issues and projects in progress, and no one else capable of handling them, it\'s getting rather stressful, and I really want some time for myself. And by that I don\'t mean just a small break, I mean finishing this chapter in my life, and moving forward. There\'s more to life, than just Streets of Rogue, after all.\\n\\n5. **Stress from work.** The projects at my work are just as bad as SoR\'s code. This factor definitely contributed to, and accelerated my descent into madness. The work conditions are really convenient though, and it\'s hard to say no to money, so I don\'t want to quit yet.\\n\\n6. **Discouragement of discussions in the community.** I saw quite a few constructive discussions on Discord get shut down for no apparent reason. I want to discuss issues and problems with the server, since, you know, discussing it is the only way to improve. But here, you\'ll get called petty and rude, if you point out a problem or that someone\'s argument doesn\'t make sense.\\n\\n7. **Questionable approval of modding.** tinyBuild is very clear about their policy of strict adherence to all services\' terms of service and agreements; and Steam\'s Subscriber Agreement does not allow <Abbr title=\\"(something that gives players an unfair advantage in multiplayer)\\">\\"cheats\\"</Abbr> and mods. If Steam Achievement Manager (the mention of which had to be deleted) is considered a \\"cheat\\", then what about *mods* that may act as these *\\"cheats\\"*? Intent is not something that can be judged objectively, after all; and a double standard is scarier than ignorance. I don\'t feel as confident when making mods, knowing that it all may come crashing down the next day.\\n\\nThe last two are far from being the deciding factors, but they did set it all in motion.  \\nAnd arguably, some of these issues can be solved, but at that point it\'d be more trouble than it\'s worth. Perhaps, I\'ll just find my happiness elsewhere. It can\'t be hard to find a place better than this.\\n\\n\\n\\n## So, what\'s next?\\n\\nI\'ll just stop working on SoR-related projects, and I\'ll archive their repositories. If you want to carry on the legacy, feel free to fork the repositories and continue working on these projects.\\n\\nThis documentation website and all currently released files and assets will remain available. The only exception is the newer beta of the website, the one at roguelibs.com, since it incurs some maintenance costs (web server, database, CMS, CDN, domain name). I\'ll wipe the data there and have it shut down. The [source repository](https://github.com/Chasmical/roguelibs-web) is still available, so feel free to host one yourself.\\n\\nThe official Discord server can carry on without me. The Russian Discord server, though, will probably bite the dust, unless someone stands up and continues managing the Russian community.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", flexWrap: \\"wrap\\", justifyContent: \\"space-around\\" }}>\\n<div>\\n\\n#### Official Discord server\\n<iframe src=\\"https://canary.discord.com/widget?id=187414758536773632&theme=dark\\" width=\\"320\\" height=\\"500\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" sandbox=\\"allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\" />\\n\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n\\n#### Russian Discord server\\n<iframe src=\\"https://canary.discord.com/widget?id=766725034445635634&theme=dark\\" width=\\"320\\" height=\\"500\\" allowtransparency=\\"true\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" sandbox=\\"allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\" />\\n\\n</div>\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey","metadata":{"permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey","editUrl":"https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2024-02-03/my-modding-journey.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-03/my-modding-journey.mdx","title":"My Modding Journey","description":"I\'ve given it some thought, and decided to quit doing Streets of Rogue stuff.

Since then, my programming skills and knowledge have vastly improved, I\'ve practiced a bit of technical writing, did some project management, web-development, learned several languages, and gotten familiar with more technical terms.\\n\\nI\'ve also reflected on the [*\\"What I hate about SoR\\"* post](/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor) and noted what I did wrong. There was too much critique, and not nearly enough examples to convey the full extent of how bad it is. I\'ve pointed out problems, but poorly explained the reasons behind my proposed solutions. Sometimes the answers hid in the irony, and that\'s not something that should be in a constructive review.\\n\\nI\'ve considered writing a second part, *\\"What I hate about SoR. Part 2\\"*, where I would clearly document and explain all the issues in the game\'s code, but ended up not finishing it. Only 3 paragraphs worth of text (about 900 words), out of planned 20-30 paragraphs. Maybe all these pieces of advice will end up on my website at some point relatively far in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n## My Modding Journey\\n\\nAnyway, let\'s go back to the very beginning...\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nIt was year 2016, and a YouTuber that I grew up watching has retired and stopped making videos. But then, 2 years later he comes back, revives the channel, makes like a hundred more videos and, not even a year later, retires once again. Among the new videos there were ~10 hours worth of gameplay recorded by one of his friends playing some weird roguelike game. That\'s how I found Streets of Rogue.\\n\\nAt the time (2019), I was fascinated by the possibilities that the game offered.  \\n\\"You can play as a Doctor and still kill people?! WOW!\\"  \\n\\"There are 17 unique, distinct characters?! WOW.\\"  \\n\\"You can make custom characters?! And there are stealth mechanics?! WOW!\\"  \\n\\"The humour in the [original] flavor texts meshes so well with the graphics and music!\\"  \\n\\"But... The Russian localization is crap.\\"\\n\\nThat was the first time I used my very basic understanding of programming and computers in general for something useful. I examined the game files, found a Localization folder, read the instructions, fixed the translations, and uploaded it as a guide on Steam. Soon after, I was contacted by someone who wanted to help, we wrote several extensive Steam guides together, and then were invited to join the Russian SoR Discord server, led by Starinis \u2013 two Twitch streamers. They had multiple other games\' communities on the same server, but I didn\'t give it much thought back then.\\n\\nDuring my stay on Starinis\' server, I learned JavaScript and created a modular multi-purpose Discord bot for their server\'s various needs. It could crosspost <Abbr title=\\"Russian equivalent of Twitter, basically\\">VKontakte</Abbr> posts, notify about new YouTube videos and Twitch streams, play music in voice channels, and it had some fun commands. In parallel with this, I tried myself in game dev, but ended up only making a cool unique inventory system. At the time I didn\'t know about value and reference types, so, kinda makes sense why I didn\'t make it far.\\n\\nBy the end of 2019, I tried my hand at modding SoR and created ECTD. Half a year later I questioned the mod-making strategy of the time, and started the BepInEx/RogueLibs revolution in modding. Then, with a firm foundation in place, I made some mods (CustomAudioLoader, RogueLibs, aToM, aToI), and edited and published some videos about them. During 2020, I gained plenty of experience with C#, Unity, ECS, graphics, IL code and patching.\\n\\nRemember Starinis, Russian SoR Discord admins, from a couple of paragraphs back? They suddenly decided to take away the channels dedicated to separate games, and put all communities in just one single channel. That day it became clear, that they were collecting game communities like pokemon, just to promote their own Twitch career. The SoR community and I had to revolt. We founded our own server, with lots of channels for all topics, and we\'ve never heard from Starinis again.\\n\\nIn 2021, I got back to JavaScript, made this documentation website, and released RogueLibs v3, which would last for a while, and created a bunch of cool and more extensive mods. Then I noticed that my interest in SoR started fading... But I wasn\'t ready to drop Streets of Rogue completely, so instead I focused my efforts on a proper website for RogueLibs, with all kinds of stuff that the big websites have: authorization, dynamic pages, CMS, API, CDN. The design and styling were tough, and in addition to that, the university was taking its toll on me, so things were going very slowly.\\n\\nIn the middle of 2022, I dropped out of university. I waited for two entire years, hoping they would eventually get serious with the programming courses, but they never did \u2013 they stuck with basic constructs, arithmetics, structures and pointers, all of which I had already learned myself three years earlier. Then I got a remote job as a web-developer, and I haven\'t had much free time ever since.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Discord in Discord\\n\\nWell, I guess, it all started with tinyBuild taking over SoR\'s community, in autumn of 2023. Due to some legal issues, they couldn\'t make the Russian Discord server official, and ended up creating 3 Russian channels on the official English server instead: #*rules*, #*general* and #*offtopic*. Predictably, everyone stayed on the Russian Discord server, but the existence of these 3 channels stumped the community\'s growth nonetheless.\\n\\nI was a moderator on the official Discord server for about 4 months, but decided to leave, because I didn\'t like the amount of seemingly irresponsible shortcuts being taken, and I felt like my efforts would be better placed elsewhere. Strangely, the statement \\"Ignorance is bliss\\" seems to almost always apply to the backstage of SoR-related things: the code behind the game\'s mechanics, the markup behind the wiki, the management behind the community. And because I\'m a perfectionist, that huge amount of little flaws and mistakes accumulated over time felt like an unliftable burden.\\n\\nThis friction made me rethink whether I want to be here at all. I reflected back on my past and realized that I don\'t have any sincere reason to be here anymore. I\'ve lost interest in the game, and it feels like I\'ve hit the ceiling, now stuck with SoR weighing me down, and unable to move forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Morals of the story\\n\\n1. Think carefully and critically of the programming courses in universities/colleges. Consider learning programming on your own, and make sure to do some research on what you\'ll learn during the courses. But most importantly, don\'t pay attention to the pretentious buzz words, look for specific knowledge instead. Let me list what some of the courses in my university had:  \\n    <div style={{ fontSize: \\"0.9rem\\", margin: \\"1rem 0\\" }}>\\n    - \\"AI and Logical programming\\" \u2013 basic binary logic and graphs. There\'s no AI ***or*** programming.\\n    - \\"Basics of Cryptography\\" \u2013 Caesar and Vigenere ciphers, and then some math tricks.\\n    - \\"Internet Culture\\" \u2013 some memes, political discussions and stuff about aggression on the web.\\n    - \\"Programming languages and transpiling\\" \u2013 writing simple programs in Assembler.\\n    - \\"Creating modern crossplatform web apps\\" \u2013 just basic HTML, JS and PHP, also, really outdated.\\n    - \\"Database technologies\\" \u2013 the very basics of MySQL, not even functions or indexes.\\n    - \\"Computer Graphics\\" \u2013 textures, shaders and shadows. I literally learned how to do that and more in the first day of me learning OpenGL! And they are stretching it all out over two entire semesters!\\n    - \\"Neural networks\\" \u2013 no nodes, no networks, just computing weird numbers, almost as if cracking hashes.\\n    - \\"Modern programming technologies\\" \u2013 solving purely geological problems for some reason.\\n    </div>\\n    I\'m not saying to completely disregard higher education though. It gives you more career opportunities, and may be a deciding factor when applying to a job, so take that into consideration.\\n\\n\\n2. If all hope is lost, you can find hope elsewhere. It\'s better to find something else that you like, than to see the thing dear to you sink to the very bottom and turn into the opposite of what it stood for. It will save you the heartbreak. Just persist, think carefully and do what you think is right.\\n\\n    I know, this advice sound a bit cynical. But that\'s the bias you get by listening to a human being \u2013 their opinion is shaped by their experiences and thoughts. And those are **my** experiences and thoughts. Think about them and take them into consideration, but never dismiss.\\n\\n3. And lastly, don\'t underestimate your own subconciousness \u2013 when you learn the reasons behind your intuition, it may already be too late. For me, it often happens when coding \u2013 some part of the project suddenly feels off, but I can\'t understand why. Then, days or weeks later, I\'d discover a fundamental flaw in the architectural design, directly related to that exact part that I doubted, forcing me to redo everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWell, thanks for reading, I guess. :smile: I hope this post helped you in one way or another."},{"id":"/2022/01/30/roguelibs-v3.5.0-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2022/01/30/roguelibs-v3.5.0-beta","editUrl":"https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2022-01-30/roguelibs-v3.5.0-beta.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-30/roguelibs-v3.5.0-beta.mdx","title":"RogueLibs v3.5.0-beta","description":"Information about the v3.5.0-beta","date":"2022-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 30, 2022","tags":[{"label":"roguelibs","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/tags/roguelibs"}],"readingTime":1.0958333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abbysssal","title":"Creator of RogueLibs","url":"https://github.com/Chasmical","imageURL":"https://github.com/Chasmical.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"RogueLibs v3.5.0-beta","author":"Abbysssal","author_title":"Creator of RogueLibs","author_url":"https://github.com/Chasmical","author_image_url":"https://github.com/Chasmical.png","tags":["roguelibs"],"description":"Information about the v3.5.0-beta","image":"https://i.imgur.com/XaNGCx7.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"My Modding Journey","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2024/02/03/my-modding-journey"},"nextItem":{"title":"What I hate about SoR","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor"}},"content":"Today RogueLibs v3.5.0 enters a long beta, because there\'s a huge list of stuff that needs to be done before the release, mainly adding new custom interactions without adding more patches.

Wait- No! I mean that the game is really **hard**coded! And the code is very **WET** - it\'s the opposite of the DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself) principle... It\'s pretty funny to say that though.\\n\\nSo, anyways, I decided to make a list of things that I hate about modding Streets of Rogue:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Global namespace\\n\\nThe first annoying thing that you notice, when you take a brief look into SoR modding, is that all of the game\'s types are in the global namespace. There\'s a couple of exceptions, though that\'s probably from the copy-pasted code.\\n\\n![Global namespace (dnSpy)](https://imgur.com/HYDcvxx.png)\\n\\nI mean, come on, just organize stuff in namespaces! Like `StreetsOfRogue` for main stuff, `StreetsOfRogue.LevelGeneration` for stuff related to level generation, `StreetsOfRogue.Objects` for all classes derived from `ObjectReal` and etc.\\n\\n### A lot of unused types and members\\n\\nThere\'s a lot of stuff, that\'s not used in the game at all. Some part of it is just some test code. The other part - is not related to Streets of Rogue at all, and probably was copy-pasted from somewhere else.\\n\\n![A lot of unused types](https://imgur.com/XNeeF8Q.png)\\n![3 unused fields in Agent class](https://imgur.com/REhaTil.png)\\n\\n### Bad names\\n\\n~~Type and member names should be descriptive. I do understand that Matt was the only one developing the game and didn\'t expect anyone to mess with the game\'s code. I also understand that you would know your own code better that anyone else, but still...~~ Although, nevermind, there\'s probably a ton of comments in the source code, that we can\'t see in the compiled assembly.\\n\\n### Too many string comparisons\\n\\nAfter a couple of minutes of browsing through the code, you\'ll notice that there\'s way too many string comparisons. You know they\'re heavy on the performance. Sometimes they\'re in places where you don\'t even need strings, for example, in `Relationships` where you could have just used enumerations (actually, Matt used **both** enumerations and strings, for some weird reason).\\n\\n### Empty strings\\n\\nFor some reason, `\\"\\"` is used instead of `string.Empty`. And for some reason `\\"\\"` in a lot of the code is equivalent to `null`. You know exactly what\'s wrong with that. In one case there **is** a string, that simply has zero length, in the other case - **nothing**, not even a string, just nothing. It\'s just plain wrong.\\n\\n![\\"\\" used instead of string.Empty or null](https://imgur.com/9rDQAe7.png)\\n\\n### Non-flexible mechanics\\n\\nFor example, `Unlock` has three fields: `unavailable`, `onlyInCharacterCreation`, `freeItem`. How do you make something available only in Item Teleporter and not available anywhere else? Not only the fields are not descriptive, but they also function significantly differently - `unavailable` makes items unavailable anywhere, while `onlyInCharacterCreation` *apparently* makes an item available **only** in CC, and `freeItem` makes it available in Item Teleporter. You could have just named them `availableInGame`, `availableInCharacterCreation`, `availableInItemTeleporter`. Then their function and purpose is obvious.\\n\\n![unavailable, onlyInCharacterCreation and freeItem fields](https://imgur.com/gjnxvNM.png)\\n\\nI spent **dozens of hours** converting that kind of system into something more maintainable: `Available`, `AvailableInCC` and `AvailableInItemTeleporter` - properties that you can find in RogueLibs. And even after that, [there still were issues](https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/issues/40). *I\'m bad at discrete mathematics, that\'s why I had a hard time doing that.*\\n\\n### Hard code\\n\\nA lot of stuff in the game is so hardcoded, that it\'s almost impossible to add something completely new and unique. You\'d have to modify code in a ton of places, even in places that you wouldn\'t even think to look in.  \\nI mean, why would you hardcode the amount of players in the game? Each player has a different field (`playerAgent`, `playerAgent2`, and so on). That\'s the only reason why creating a multiplayer game with more than 4 players is impossible.\\n\\n### Toolkit 2D library\\n\\nI spent **months** trying to figure out how this fucking library works! There\'s no documentation on it. I mean, there are a couple of guides on how to use it in Unity Editor, but there\'s nothing on how it works internally. There are way too many unused classes, methods, properties and features, and for some reason the classes are in the global namespace. I\'m surprised that Matt even figured out how to use it.\\n\\n### Disregard of common programming principles\\n\\nA lot of methods have way too many instructions in them and sometimes they do stuff that you wouldn\'t expect them to do. Just split these different features into different methods.  \\n**KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**.\\n\\nA lot of methods have a lot of repeating code. You can put that repeating code in a separate method. That will save you a ton of time writing new methods, plus, the code will be easier to read.  \\n**DRY principle (Don\'t Repeat Yourself)**.\\n\\n### Binary serialization\\n\\n![Comparison of raw binary data and XML-formatted file](https://imgur.com/bl0tEOj.png)\\n\\nWhy would you use binary serialization? It\'s completely unreadable!  \\nJust use XML, JSON or whatever markup language you want, anything but raw binary data!\\n\\n### Classes are used like structs\\n\\nMatt clearly doesn\'t understand the difference between reference and value types.\\n\\n### Lack of properties\\n\\nInstead of constantly setting and updating fields\' values in `Awake`, `Start` and other methods, you should just use properties. This way you won\'t have to constantly update fields\' values, once you change one other field\'s value. The code will instantly become more maintainable.\\n\\n![MyStart method sets up fields and is called in every other method](https://imgur.com/gI7WV4I.png)\\n\\n### Virtual methods\\n\\nInstead of putting dozens of empty virtual methods in a base class and overriding them in a couple of derived types, you should use interfaces! That\'s literally what they were created for.\\n\\n![Empty virtual methods](https://imgur.com/aKQA76v.png)\\n\\n### Lack of events\\n\\nInstead of checking for conditions of doing something on every frame update, you should use events. That\'s literally what they were created for. As a bonus, there\'s no 1-frame delay, that you get from checking conditions every frame. And also, you know, checking event conditions every frame is a little bit excessive and definitely uses way too much CPU.\\n\\n### Giant `for` loops\\n\\n![A lot of really big and inefficient loops](https://imgur.com/kY8gtia.png)\\n\\nWhy would you try to repeat the operation, if you know that the results will be exactly the same?\\n\\n![An unnecessary for loop](https://imgur.com/vjCshb5.png)\\n\\nWhy the hell would you write all of these giant `for` loops with a ton of conditions, `break`s and `continue`s and stuff like that, when there are already methods that do exactly that?  \\n**Just use System.Linq extensions and List&lt;T&gt; methods!**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWell, that\'s it. For now, at least..."},{"id":"/2021/08/18/roguelibs-v3.1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/18/roguelibs-v3.1.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/Chasmical/RogueLibs/edit/main/website/blog/blog/2021-08-18/roguelibs-v3.1.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-18/roguelibs-v3.1.0.md","title":"RogueLibs v3.1.0","description":"Completely replaced the vanilla localization system.","date":"2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 18, 2021","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/tags/blog"},{"label":"roguelibs","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/tags/roguelibs"}],"readingTime":2.4166666666666665,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abbysssal","title":"Creator of RogueLibs","url":"https://github.com/Chasmical","imageURL":"https://github.com/Chasmical.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"RogueLibs v3.1.0","author":"Abbysssal","author_title":"Creator of RogueLibs","author_url":"https://github.com/Chasmical","author_image_url":"https://github.com/Chasmical.png","tags":["blog","roguelibs"],"description":"Completely replaced the vanilla localization system.","image":"https://i.imgur.com/XaNGCx7.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What I hate about SoR","permalink":"/RogueLibs/blog/2021/08/31/what-i-hate-about-sor"}},"content":"Today a new version of RogueLibs v3.1.0 was released!\\n\\nA brand new localization system will completely replace the vanilla one!\\n\\n- Fancy, easy-to-use XML files, for each language separately;\\n- Fixed the bug with \\"E_\\" prefixes appearing in random places;\\n- Custom languages support;\\n- Community translations;\\n- Automatic updates;\\n- Live Reloading!\\n\\n![Locales opened in VSCode](https://i.imgur.com/XaNGCx7.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Upgrading/downgrading to XML\\n\\nOn one hand, we lose some of th-, I mean, the **one** advantage of CSV files:\\n\\n- **Small size.**  \\n  Not as compact, as physically possible, but still, it has a relatively low data-to-size ratio, close to 1. The only non-data characters are commas, the surrounding quotes, double quotes inside of expressions and new lines.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, we gain a ton of advantages of XML:\\n\\n- **Easy to read.**  \\n  Humans can open the file in a text editor, and it will automatically highlight the XML syntax.  \\n- **Easy to edit.**  \\n  Modern text editors check for errors in XML, making it almost impossible to corrupt the file.\\n- **Easy to parse.**  \\n  Computers can easily parse XML files with the built-in `System.Xml.Serialization` (in case of C#). There\'s no need for any overcomplicated regular expressions used in the game.\\n\\n### Categorizing translations by language\\n\\nThe vanilla game loads all languages at the same time, regardless of what language is selected.\\n\\nRogueLibs will load only the ones, that are actually used: the selected one and the fallback one (default: English), that will be used in case an entry is missing in the selected language.\\n\\nThis loading strategy allows you to select from thousands of different localizations, without loading all of them at the same time.\\n\\n### Automatic updates\\n\\nWhen you launch the game, RogueLibs will download a small \\"index\\" file with some metadata, and then it will decide what translations should be updated. Don\'t worry, it won\'t check for updates too frequently, just once every hour.\\n\\n### Community translations\\n\\nSpeaking of translations... **The vanilla translations are terrible**. I\'m not sure what the situation is like with other languages, but russian localization is really bad:\\n\\n- Some words are taken out of context. \\"Glass\\", as in \\"a glass wall\\", not as in \\"a glass of milk\\".\\n- \\"Chunk Pack\\" was literally translated as a \\"pack\\" of \\"chunks\\". I\'m not sure how to explain that, but it caused quite a lot of comotion in the russian community.\\n- Some words are not translated at all. \\"Walkie-Talkie\\" is still a \\"Walkie-Talkie\\". What kind of translator were they even using? Every online translator I could find translated it correctly.\\n- Some translation lines were shifted a couple of lines up or down, for some reason. As if someone was editing it in Excel.\\n- There was also a ton of different styles. Sometimes \\"\u2014\\" was used instead of \\"-\\", \\"\u2026\\" instead of \\"...\\" and stuff like that. As if there were at least 3 different translators, one using Word, other one - Excel and another one - Notepad.\\n- \\"Monkey Barrel\\" \u2192 \\"\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c\\". What the f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*.\\n- I spent about 2 days, working from morning to night, to fix all of that.\\n\\nAnd that\'s why RogueLibs will use community translations instead of official ones.\\n\\nFeel free to contribute by checking the localization files yourself and making any necessary changes.
